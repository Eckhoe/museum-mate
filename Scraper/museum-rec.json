The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par).

Many advertisements are included, of local interest is the B.L. Currie Boarding and Stables, Chautauqua Boat and Bath Houses, Greene and Cupson Livery, boarding and sales stable, Wm McClelland West End Store and many other Toronto businesses.

It was representative of a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.\nChautauqua Hotel was built in 1887 and destroyed by fire Aug 25th, 1909. The hotel was built on land originally called Crookston. It was later purchased by the Niagara Assembly for a religious and intellectual summer resort. The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.\nThe grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.\nWith a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned down in 1909.","People":"Lake, John N.\nDonogh, John\nHowland, W.H.\nPeake, L.C.\n","Subjects":"Niagara Assembly\nHotel Chautauqua\nB.L.

Built in 1817 it is a single storey home with archaded detail similiar to the \"Western Home for Girls\" located near by. The home was originally built for the Widow Cameron and is an example of a Neo-Classic Georgian Cottage. An expansion in the back was added in 1860 which included a summer kitchen. In 1871 the building was purchased by Mrs Rye's Western Home for Girl's. The Western Home was in operation from 1869 thru 1895 when the institution was transfered to the Church of England Waife and Stray's Society which stayed in operation until 1913. The main Western Home was demolisted around 1914. The cottage was used by the Polish Army during WWI while training at Niagara Camp. A long period of dereliction left only the cottage portion of the house remaining. The current owner has done extensive restoration which includes a new addition to the back of the original cottage. The house is located at 708 King Street. The perspective is from the corner of King Street and Cottage Street, facing south-east.\n\nJohn G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949.

The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel.\n\nThis wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930.

Book 5 and book 6 had letters on the coupons, B, S, M, Y, V, and X.\nRationing is a form of controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services. The theory is to allow each individual a portion of the scarce resource which is being distributed over a specific time period. It is used to control resource pricing through manipulating supply and demand and tries to reduce the spread of a black market.

The following is a description of the newspapers that contain articles of interest. The \"Farmers Watch-Tower\" of July, 1812 has articles that discuss an \"Inquiry into the causes of the present grievance of America\", which discusses the need to increase manufacturing in the US. There is a letter from a young Englishman who advises against war between Britain and the US. In addition, the paper features a print of the act declaring war with Britain and a proclamation concerning the American support in the war by President James Madison. There are also articles discussing relations with 'indians', including a letter from a young man that joined General Johnson's expedition against the 'indians' in Tennessee. Other articles of interest include a celebration of American independence on July 4th at Fort Manary and a \"Patriotic Song by Ethan Stone. Tune-Yankee Doodle\" that discusses the fall of Canada. The chorus states: \"Saratoga to them all, Bunker's Hill confound them, soon the Canadas shall fall, when freedom's sons surround them.\" There is also a small public notice to return, if found, several horses owned by the US Army, Commanded by General Hull, that had recently fled. The December 2nd, 1812 issue of the \"Farmers Watch-Tower\" has many articles discussing topics about the ongoing war. Of interest, it includes a letter from Benjamin Hawkins Esq. to the Creek Nation discussing a pact with the US to be loyal and refuse arms from the British. There are a few letters from Capt. Eliott and Commandore John Rodgers to the Secretary of the Navy discussing encounters with the British forces.

Hakes by Mrs. Sarah L. Willard, Principal of the Troy Female Seminary","Date":"October 1863","Description":"Obituary of Gertrude S. Hakes. Cover is black with gold trim, text and image of mourners at a graveyard. Gertrude S. Hakes died at Port Robinson Ontario August 27, 1863. She was the adopted daughter of J.S. and Maria S. Hakes.\n\nTranscription is as follows:\n\nDied. At Port Robinson, Canada West, August 27, 1863, Mrs. Gertrude S. Blake, aged 24 years, adopted daughter of J.S. and Maria S. Hakes, of this city.\nThis notice appeared in our papers without a word of sorrow or regret for the early and sudden exit it announced.\nMy relations to the deceased were so intimate that I could claim the privilege of being silent in my grief. She was so dear to me that it is difficult for me to trust myself to speak of her. Yet I cannot allow one to pass away who was so much the pride and joy of our school for many years without some record of her great worth, and our great loss.\nA thousand loving and admiring hearts must crave a tribute to her memory.\nBut what shall we say of her whose short life was spent in preparing to live? Mrs. Blake had just entered upon the career of usefulness which is woman's destiny when summoned to another sphere. She had lived long enough, however, as a wife and mother to show that she could meet, with case and skill, the claims of every social and domestic relation; that she could reproduce, in a home of her own, the beauty, comfort and hallowed influences of the home of her childhood; that she brought to the fulfillment of these duties a devout spirit, sound judgement, great energy, presistency, and enthusaism, added to affections which prompted her to consecrate all her powers to the good of others, and that high intellectual tastes and attainments, all compatable with excellence in the domestic arts, to show rich endowments well trained and used in the family, the church and the school. As a pupil of the Seminary her memory will be most lovingly and respectfully cherished, - by her classmates as one with whom it was difficult to compete - who stimulated them to their highest efforts - who took every honor of the Insitution, and was first in every brilliant achievement of scholarship.\nForce of character, and the submissiveness of christian spirit were envinced and cultivated by her constant struggle with physical weakness.\nRegulating the languor to which she was subject, and her frequent illness, as appointed by Divine Wisdom, for her moral discipline, she waited patiently for strength; pursued, with zest, a second term, or year, studies which her health would not permit her to learn throughly the first; devoted as many years as were thus made neccessary to complete the full course of study, and exercised so much good sense in the care of her health that she grew in strength as she grew in knoweldge - the willing spirit triumphant over the weak body.\nWhile our hearts are bowed with our own grief, and a sense of the loss to society of a woman so eminently fitted in teh discharge of all the affairs of love and friendship to bless it, we are sensible that the burden of this great sorrow rests upon the husband, her infant children, and her adopted parents, Mr. and Mrs. Hakes.\nTo the latter she had evern been a beloved daughter. She came to them a bright and joyous child. They enjoyed the unfolding of her characterin the atmosphere of domestic and christian love with which they surrounded her. They afforded her facilities for the liberal culture which her powers demanded. Hopes and aspirations for her which had been excited by her high aims and resolves had been more than satisfied by the wealth of her attainments and resources. The strength, elevation and harmony of her character, she had become the delightful companion and most valued friend. When they gave her up to new relations they were happy in witnessing the broader culture which sprung from her new duties and affections.\nCalled upon for the final seperation their consolation is that her noblest development will come from Divine Wisdom, teaching her to solve the dark mysteries of earth in the light of heaven. Their's are not buried joys and hopes, but such as lead their sould to antipate the enjoyment of her gifts and graces in that celestial home where there shall be joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighling shall flee away.\nShe had prepared for the presence of our Lord, and when summoned to it her faith failed not. Her Saviour, whom she had glorified on earth by dedicating herself to him in early youth, and doing the work of life as in his service, supported her in her dying hour by the blessed hope that he would glorify her in heaven. It is mysterious to us that one so amply furnished with armor for the most comprehensive life-work should be smitten just as the battle of life had commenced. Yet her life is not lost. It was not a failure. She will be cherished as the type of a christian woman. Her numerous associates, to whose sorrowful regrets I give voice, will not allow her example to die. As they weep for her they will emulate her virtues.\nSarah L.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long. The club house was the former Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.","Subjects":"Fort George Golf Course\nFort Mississauga Golf Course\nRecreation and Leisure\nSports\nGolfing","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852047(a_b).jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852047(a_b)-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852047(a_b)-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852047(a_b)-4.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852047(a_b)-5.jpg"]},{"Id":"19DCDE4F-6CFE-4B01-9F85-068080984164","Name":"Certificate:Marriage","Object ID":"978.94","Date":"1822-DEC.23","Dimensions":"31 X 20 CM.","Description":"Marriage certificate of John Whitten and Jane Cassidy signed by Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada and certified by Rev.

It was written during his journeys to the Canadian and American West. (1864-65).\n\nTopics discussed in the letter include:\nBlake writes of his concern for his uncle John's cough. He says John should visit him as the is a pure water establishment, \"something like the Stevenson House\". Blake mentions his children, Herb and Ada. He talks of the extreme hot weather, 104 in the shade at the time of writing. Blake writes about unloading self loading rifles sent by Clark(?) from Washington. These rifles shoot 16 times without taking them from the shoulder. They are as accurate as those used in Canada and much handsomer. Blake saw a large lot of Buffalo skins come in from the praries and he wished he'd been among them with one of those riles.\n\nHe writes of Mrs. Cittenden and family enjoying their visit to the farm. He is sorry that Deal Smith is in poor health and says that she should be taking lots of ale and porter. He writes that he is pleased that the stone has been put up but wishes he knew what the freight and charges were. (Assume this stone is for Blake's first wife, Gertrude who died in 1863)\nHe mentions that he does not know why his uncle Sam Stocking has visited his mother and children again. Blake writes about the place he is in that, the only thing to do is buy land and raise stock. Blake is concerned that Sam Stocking should \"sell the milk so I can get my money\". Blake writes that he needs the money so he can send some to his mother to buy shoes for Mary. He suggests that the shoes be bought at Welsh's on credit. Clark has arrived and Blake and Clark will be starting out very soon. He says that his mother should write to him every week and it will be forwarded to him. Blake says that he will not have any chance to write to her. Blake tells his mother that he does not intend to go into the army. Blake says that Aunt Sally says Aunt Liddy's cancer is better. Aunt Sally wants Uncle John to come to Roscoe. He can go from Buffalo to Chicago on a steam boat for $9.00 U.S. and from there to Roscoe for 2 or 3 dollars. Blake talks of Clark getting the Rail Road going and if it succeeds it will open up a large tract of country. He then writes about how expensive everything is, as compared to Buffalo. He writes about his children's health. He asks that his uncle give his regards to Henderson and Milloy. He then talks about the deer and prairie chickens that are so plentiful for shooting. He says he could fill the whole of Niagara with deer and chickens by himself. He complains that he is not getting replies to his letters. He asks that Agg take good care of Phils (his dog). He says the dog would be of great value to min and if he came again he would bring him even if it cost $100.00. Prices for dogs are #50 - $100 and they sell quickly.","People":"Blake, John Alexander\nBlake, Mary Ann (nee Rogers)\nBlake, Herbert Rogers\nStocking, Sam\n","Subjects":"American West","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b).jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b)-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b)-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b)-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"5F51579B-8F98-495B-B1EB-578749329530","Name":"Book:Account","Object ID":"988.5.474","Date":"1823","Dimensions":"19.5 x 16 cm","Description":"Accounts referring to finishing carpentry details and hours worked, and purchases.

Titled: View of Fort Niagara from Canadian side.\nMary Jones was one of the founding members of the RJR pottery group along with Bill Richardson and Dr. Bruce Riggs.\n\nRJR Pottery was produced in Niagara-on-the Lake between 1950 and 1964. The pottery was produced as a hobby and the output was mainly sold to friends. There were no duplicates of any of the pieces. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston. Located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved to the pottery. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr Bruce Rigg office and at a home on King Street.\nFort Niagara is located on the eastern side of the Niagara River opposite Niagara-on-the-Lake. First built in 1678, the fort is now dominated by the 'French Castle' which was built in 1726. The current renovated fort is now known as Fort Niagara State Part and Museum.","People":"Jones, Mary Heward\n","Subjects":"RJR Pottery","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/thumbs/2018003002.jpg"]},{"Id":"AE374B65-F9CC-4872-B4C5-341232484190","Name":"Letter","Object ID":"988.5.521","Date":"1925","Dimensions":"28 x 21 cm","Description":"Letter to the Town Council of Niagara-on-the-Lake regarding the water tax of the Queens Royal Hotel.\n\nTranscription is as follows:\n\n\"The Queens Royal\nNiagara-on-the-Lake Canada\nMay 9, 1925\nThe Honorable Mayor and Common Council\nTown of Niagara\nNiagara-on-the-Lake\nGentlemen:\nMay I be permitted to present herewith on behalf of Queens Royal Hotel Limited a petition on which we pray will merit the consideration and approval of your honorable body.\nWe have been given to understand that in the past the water tax on the Queens Royal Hotel property has been remitted in whole or at least in part, it being considered that such an arrangement was one of mutual enefit in as much as the hotel has brought people to Niagara-on-the-Lake who naturally left some money in the community.

It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855.\n\nSometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a \"coloured\" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the \"Negro Burial Ground\".\n\nUnfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations. The births listed in 1849 are:\n\"George Hunter (?), daughter; January 22, 1849-Mary Matilda\n\"Mr. Samuel Graham of a son. Born Aug 18, 1849-William Henry\n\"Jack (?) Washington of a daughter.

Originated 1877, Incorporated 1902.\n\nThe history of golf in Niagara began in 1877, a few practice holes were laid out on the Fort George Commons by a returning officer of the British Army. The next year on the Mississauga Common a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890's golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first international Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course has never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long, a score card states that it is a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long. The club house was the former Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.\n\nNote that the photograph only shows the plans of the Fort George golf course and no other pages from the booklet.","Subjects":"Plan of Niagara Golf Links 1902\nFort George Golf Course\nFort Mississauga Golf Course\nNiagara Golf Club\nJunior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.\nGolf\nSports and Recreation","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/022/thumbs/994208.jpg"]},{"Id":"204FEF81-3D55-4F2C-987B-363641057233","Name":"Envelope","Object ID":"1999.005.118","Date":"May 28, 1932","Dimensions":"15 x 9CM","Description":"A notice of uncollected taxes from J.M Crysler, Clerk of the Township of Niagara to Sydney Morris for lot 185 in Chautauqua.","People":"Morris, Sydney\nCrysler, John Morten\nSheppard, James H.\n","Subjects":"Return to sender\nArrear of Taxes\nChautauqua\nPlan 73 A\nproperty taxes\nUncollected taxes\nMississauga Beach Company","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/089/thumbs/1999005118-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/089/thumbs/1999005118.jpg"]},{"Id":"E13C4BB0-5D9C-43C4-9F9A-220613745190","Name":"Register","Object ID":"2000.080","Title":"A REGISTER RECORDING THE BIRTHS IN NIAGARA FROM 1848-1856","Date":"1848","Dimensions":"DIMENSIONS: 16.9cm x 20.5cm","Description":"This register contains a written record of the births and baptisms in the Town of Niagara from 1848 through 1856.

Championship.\nLadies Event.\nSt. Andrew's Rules of Play.\nPlayed at The Niagara Golf Links.\n\nThe history of golf in Niagara began in 1877, a few practice holes were laid out on the Fort George Commons by a returning officer of the British Army. The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par).

He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer.\nWhen the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year.\nThe recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.\nWhen asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. \"I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare\" said the Colonel. \"My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.\"\nWindeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going.

Culver","Date":"October 26, 1812","Dimensions":"10 x 8.8 cm","Description":"Lincoln Militia Leave pass for Ebenezer Culver during the War of 1812.\n\nDuring the summer and into the autumn of 1812, the small British garrisons at Fort George, Amherstburg, Fort York and other posts relied on Militiamen to augment their forces to defend against expected American attacks. Militia volunteers in the \"flank companies\" of regiments were expected to serve longer periods of active duty and were trained to fight alongside the well-trained British regulars. The regular or \"sedentary\" militia, comprised of all able men between the ages of 16 and 60, were given rudimentary training and were expected to be available for shorter periods of time, \"called up\" to work on road repairs, sentry duty, rowing bateaux, transporting supplies, and so on. They were also expected to fight if required but mostly within their own home areas. Militiamen had been involved in the capture of Michilimackinac in July and the capture of Detroit in August, 1812, and were a key factor in the British victory at the Battle of Queenston Heights on October 13, fighting alongside the British regulars and First Nations allies.\nOne of the problems with the militiamen was that many of the men were also farmers, constantly worried about their farms when they were away on active service, particularly during the planting and the harvest times. At Fort George, many of the militiamen absented themselves without leave to travel home to do the haying or the harvest. Officially, they were considered deserters, a very serious crime in the British Army. However, almost all of the men returned to duty after finishing whatever they needed to do on their farms. Few thought this a serious transgression. The British did not take it so lightly, court-martialling and heavily fining those who had gone AWOL once they returned.\nFor the British, they needed a body of militiamen on which they could rely to be where they were expected to be at any given time. The rules on desertion were strictly enforced to ensure that however many militiamen were expected to be on duty were indeed present and accounted for. They also realized that these men had to return to their farms from time to time to ensure that their families had sufficient food and that agriculture did not generally suffer as a result of their military service. After all, the British garrisons relied on locally grown food along with the salt beef, salt pork, dried peas and barrels of flour shipped from England.\nTo control the situation, the British required militiamen on active duty to apply for leaves of absence, which would be granted when the situation permitted. To enforce the system, patrols of Regulars and Militia watched the roads and questioned men of military age, apprehending those suspected of being AWOL from active duty. This would have been rather trying, as few militiamen were provided with uniforms in 1812 and would have been indistinguishable from farmers and tradesmen not on active military duty, simply going about their business. In some cases, First Nations allies were paid a bounty for bringing in deserters from the Regular Army and militiamen who had taken their leave without permission.\nIt was very much in a man's favour to apply for legitimate leave, something readily granted providing that there was no obvious threats looming in that theatre of war. Those with permission were given a passport to carry, a slip of paper signed by their regimental colonel, granting them leave but ensuring that they were prepared to be immediately called back from leave in the situation required. When the recipient of this pass was questioned while on his way home, the passport provided proof that he was legally away from his post and not a deserter.\nThis artifact is a rare example of such a passport, signed by Lieutenant-Colonel William Claus, Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Lincoln Militia. The date of the paper was two weeks after the Battle of Queenston Heights. No further trouble was expected that year and the British felt safe releasing a number of militiamen from active duty on the understanding that they would be called back if required.","People":"Culver, Ebenezer\n","Subjects":"War of 1812\nLincoln Militia","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/064/thumbs/2012028001.jpg"]},{"Id":"3CB0B691-E356-424D-8160-330699895722","Name":"Leaflet","Object ID":"989.5.711","Description":"A pamphlet to a memorial honoring Laura Secord.

In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par).

It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855.\n\nSometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a \"coloured\" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the \"Negro Burial Ground\".\n\nUnfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations. The births listed in 1849 are:\n\"George Hunter (?), daughter; January 22, 1849-Mary Matilda\n\"Mr. Samuel Graham of a son. Born Aug 18, 1849-William Henry\n\"Jack (?) Washington of a daughter.

Pottery Shop and Kiln in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The forgotten story of an old town pottery by Monica and Richard Taylor.\nHistory, photographs and descriptions of the work done by the R.J.R. group. Published by the Niagara Historical Society.\nRJR Pottery was produced in Niagara-on-the Lake between 1950 and 1964 as a hobby and the output was mainly sold to friends. There were no duplicates of any piece created. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. He dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston and located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr. Bruce Rigg's office and home on King Street.","People":"Burroughs, Sara (nee Rigg)\nRigg, Doctor Charles Bruce\nJones, Mary Heward\nRichardson, Bill\nTaylor, Monica\nTaylor, Richard\n","Subjects":"R.J.R.

Pottery Shop and Kiln in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The forgotten story of an old town pottery by Monica and Richard Taylor.\nHistory, photographs and descriptions of the work done by the R.J.R. group. Published by the Niagara Historical Society.\nRJR Pottery was produced in Niagara-on-the Lake between 1950 and 1964 as a hobby and the output was mainly sold to friends. There were no duplicates of any piece created. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. He dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston and located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr. Bruce Rigg's office and home on King Street.","People":"Burroughs, Sara (nee Rigg)\nRigg, Doctor Charles Bruce\nJones, Mary Heward\nRichardson, Bill\nTaylor, Monica\nTaylor, Richard\n","Subjects":"R.J.R.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks.

The sketch was donated to the museum by Mary Ann Guillen, Mr. Riley's daughter, who was Janet Carnochan's major source of information about the town's 19th century black community. The drawing was done for Mrs. Guillen by a female acquaintance, shortly before the squared timber building was pulled down in the 1880's. William Riley, an escaped slave from Fredericksburg, Virginia, bought the one acre town lot, 276, at the corner of Mary and Victoria streets, from William Dickson for £50 in 1819, becoming the third black man to own property in the village. The price was fair for land in the area. However, one does wonder why Mr. Dickson paid only five shillings for it a short time earlier. Neither transaction was registered until 1886. Mr. Riley built the house in 1819, a year after his marriage at Lake Lodge (the home of Rev. Robert Addison), to Rev. Addison's German servant Fanny. By 1851, eight family members lived in the house: William, Fanny (a. 57), their children Mary Ann (27), Fanny (20), Edward (18) and three grandchildren, William (11), Fanny (3) and Edward (1). After Riley's death in 1860, Edward and his sisters inherited lot 276. The last family member to own the land was William's granddaughter, Fanny Rowley, who also owned 177 King and 143 King Street, and the Rowley Block on Queen Street. She left town in 1905, ending the family's connection with lot 276. Mrs. Guillen's lively and informative recollections about the Riley family and the larger black community can be found in Niagara Historical Society Pamphlet #2.","People":"Riley, William\nDickson, William\nGuillen, Mary Ann\n","Subjects":"coloured village\nslave\nKing Street\nWilliam Street\nAnn Street\nButler Street","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/026/thumbs/991090.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/085/thumbs/991090-6.jpg"]},{"Id":"3E46486B-9E83-431C-A950-522964496524","Name":"Book:Ration","Object ID":"1998.014.05","Date":"1946","Dimensions":"13 X 8.5 CM","Description":"Canadian Ration Book 6 issued to Henry Friesen R.R.2 Niagara-on-the Lake.

Completed in just over a year, this Classical Revival building with its carved keystones and elaborate portico is a focal point of the Queen Street streetscape. Built originally as the seat of government for Lincoln County, it is, to this day, an important civic structure. It is designated under the Ontario Heritage Act, protected by an Ontario Heritage Trust easement and is also a National Historic Site.","People":"Thomas, William\nGarvie, James\nDavidson, John\nHamilton, Alexander\n","Subjects":"Court House\nQueen Street\ncourthouse","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/020/thumbs/9905336.jpg"]},{"Id":"204FEF81-3D55-4F2C-987B-363641057233","Name":"Envelope","Object ID":"1999.005.118","Date":"May 28, 1932","Dimensions":"15 x 9CM","Description":"A notice of uncollected taxes from J.M Crysler, Clerk of the Township of Niagara to Sydney Morris for lot 185 in Chautauqua.","People":"Morris, Sydney\nCrysler, John Morten\nSheppard, James H.\n","Subjects":"Return to sender\nArrear of Taxes\nChautauqua\nPlan 73 A\nproperty taxes\nUncollected taxes\nMississauga Beach Company","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/089/thumbs/1999005118-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/089/thumbs/1999005118.jpg"]},{"Id":"5F13DEA5-EE45-4A51-8C3C-445338156781","Name":"Receipt","Object ID":"995.133","Date":"1942-DEC.16","Description":"Receipt for a purchase made on pork.

Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer.\nWhen the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year.\nThe recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.\nWhen asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. \"I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare\" said the Colonel. \"My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.\"\nWindeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going.

Windeyer.\nRichard C. Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer.\nWhen the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year.\nThe recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.\nWhen asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. \"I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare\" said the Colonel. \"My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.\"\nWindeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going. He was later given command of Niagara Camp for a short period of time.","People":"Windeyer, Richard C.\nWindeyer, Richard Cunningham\nWindeyer, Jessie\n","Subjects":"36th Regiment\n36 Regiment\n74th Battalion\n74 Battalion\nNiagara Camp\nFirst World War\nWorld War One\nInfantry\nCanadian Expeditionary Force\nCEF\nMilitia","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/thumbs/2018016019ac.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/thumbs/2018016019ac-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/thumbs/2018016019ac-3.jpg"]},{"Id":"9848ACCA-DB04-452B-9C05-312823428496","Name":"article","Object ID":"2004.027.121(A-B)","Title":"Bulletin of the Ontario College of Pharmacy","Date":"1968","Dimensions":"A: 16cm x 22.8cm\nB: 15cm x 22.8cm","Description":"Articles from the \"Bulletin of the Ontario College of Pharmacy\", that provides a description of the contents of the Apothecary (5 Queen Street) and requests donations for its restoration as a Museum.","People":"Moisley, P.T.\nPaterson, G.R.\nStieb, Ernest W.\nStarkwather, Rodman\nWensley, William R.\nField, Erland (Earl) W.\n","Subjects":"Niagara Apothecary Shop\nField's Drug Store\nOntario College of Pharmacy\nNiagara Foundation\nBulletin of the Ontario College of Pharmacy\napothecary\ndrug store\nmedicine","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/081/thumbs/2004027121(ab)-1.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/081/thumbs/2004027121(ab)-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/081/thumbs/2004027121(ab)-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/081/thumbs/2004027121(ab)-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"A564FFB8-C251-49C8-A0F9-463404045940","Name":"Register:Attendance","Object ID":"991.1084.03","Date":"1846-FEB.","Description":"Attendance register for #2 Union School in the Township of Thorold.

Several Blocks were sold to outsiders by Joseph Brant on reluctant agreement of Peter Russell, Administrator of the government of Upper Canada, in 1797. Brant was eventually forbidden to sell more lands, but he had partially gotten around this by issuing 999-year leases. When Brant died in 1807, the majority of the Haldimand Tract was still in Six Nation's hands.\nIn 1820-21, John Brant and Robert Johnson Kerr tried to get permission to sell their lands without Government approval. The Imperial Government (presumably the \"Secretary of the State for the Colonies\") granted them this opportunity only if the Council of Six Nations unanimously agreed. The colonial officials in Upper Canada and William Claus were shocked that this was granted.\n\nThe speech that is being referenced in this letter occurred when Claus addressed the Council of Chiefs in August 1822, at which time he warned the chiefs that if they were to sell their lands as freeholders, they would no longer receive the annual 'King's Bounty', and like all enfranchised male citizens in the province, they would be required to serve in the militia, pay taxes, and maintain the roads/bridges in their community. Claus also warned them that if they sold more of their lands, the future of the Indigenous settlement on the Grand River would be doomed.","People":"Brant, John\nClench, Joseph Brant\nClaus, William\n","Subjects":"Fort George\nSpeech\nFive Nations\nIndian\nFirst Nations\nIndian Affairs\nIndian Department","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/077/thumbs/2018010004.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/077/thumbs/2018010004-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/077/thumbs/2018010004-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/077/thumbs/2018010004-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"839BADD6-13A5-4B28-97E6-668327285161","Name":"Indenture","Object ID":"982.318.74","Date":"September 1, 1835","Dimensions":"32 x 20 cm","Description":"This document is an agreement of Jacob Gonder (Gander) to lease his land and house to William Robinson.\nSpecifically, \"his house and land near the River Niagara in the village of Waterloo Township of Bertie.\"\nThis agreement was made September 1, 1835 at the village of Waterloo in the Township of Bertie.\nRent was one pound currency to be paid monthly in advance for twelve calendar months.\n\nIt was witnessed by William A Warren.

The ship was 377 feet long and could carry 2,500 people as well as horses, wagons, vehicles, fruit, and supplies.\n\nThe Cayuga was also the most popular in the fleet. It was sometimes referred to as the ship of romance for the many who met their future husbands/wives on its travels and for the many proposals that happened during moonlight cruises and dances. Each summer on its first voyage of the season, children and parents from Niagara were invited for a free trip up the Niagara River to Queenston and back.

Pottery Shop and Kiln in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The forgotten story of an old town pottery by Monica and Richard Taylor.\nHistory, photographs and descriptions of the work done by the R.J.R. group. Published by the Niagara Historical Society.\nRJR Pottery was produced in Niagara-on-the Lake between 1950 and 1964 as a hobby and the output was mainly sold to friends. There were no duplicates of any piece created. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. He dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston and located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr. Bruce Rigg's office and home on King Street.","People":"Burroughs, Sara (nee Rigg)\nRigg, Doctor Charles Bruce\nJones, Mary Heward\nRichardson, Bill\nTaylor, Monica\nTaylor, Richard\n","Subjects":"R.J.R.

It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855.\n\nSometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a \"coloured\" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the \"Negro Burial Ground\".\n\nUnfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations. The births and deaths listed in 1853 are:\nDeaths: 1853, January 3rd- James Robinson; 1853 January 11th-Francess Hoitt; 1853 February 14th- Charles Samuel Luis; 1853 October 26th- Caroline York\nBirths: 1853 November 4th, Dulleina (?) orphan daughter of Jane Bullett (?)","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/080/thumbs/9905403.jpg"]},{"Id":"BD93211C-AE79-4428-AF4D-039658764134","Name":"List","Object ID":"982.318.86","Date":"1840","Dimensions":"32 x 20.5\n15 pages","Description":"These pages contain information used for tax assessments.

The document appears to have been written by Andrew Cohoe on October 16, 1839, but Andrew had died in 1790, and had no relatives named for him. This document reads: \"This may certify that I Andrew Cahoe [Cohoe] moved with Edward Topping [Toppham] on lot No 1 in the 8th concession of the Township of Pelham and lived there ten years during which time I helped clear and fence from the North West corner at the old stake thence South on the line nearby falf the length of said lot or as far as it is cleared now at this time. And the line was easily traced at that time both north and south.\n\nAnd the fence was built to or nearly to the line. And the corner stake was there yet when I left the said place which was in the year one thousand eight hundred and four.\nN.B. The graves were all west of said line. Andrew Cahoe 16th of 10 month 1839.\"\nAndrew came to Niagara in 1787 with his wife, Deborah and seven children, and received a land grant in the Township of Pelham. He petitioned the government for this land prior to his death, but it had not been issued until after. The fact that this document states that he lived on this property for 10 years is curious since he died approximately 3 years after arriving in Niagara. Following Andrews death, his wife petitioned the government in 1799 to have the deed of the property in her name or have it divided between her children. The province approved this. Her eldest son, Asta, was barred from obtaining any of this property has he had enlisted in the Rangers and then soon after deserted and fled the province. Following the death of her husband, Deborah eventually married Edward Topham.\n\nPerhaps this document was forged in an effort for Asta and his descendants to gain access to this land.","People":"Cahoe, Andrew\nTopping, Edward\n","Subjects":"property clearing\nproperty lines\nGander property\nlot 1, concession 8\nTownship of Pelham\ngraves","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/082/thumbs/98231883.jpg"]},{"Id":"7CE537EB-C105-45A3-9648-239041517140","Name":"Postcard","Object ID":"2011.031.047","Title":"U.

Also included are papers relating to trade with the Indians; papers relating to Johnson's activities during the French and Indian War, particularly the Battle of Lake George in 1755; the construction of Johnson's homes, Fort Johnson and Johnson Hall; the erection of public buildings for use by the county seat in Johnstown, N.Y. and other papers reflecting Johnson's role as a prominent figure on the colonial frontier.\n\nThe collection also contains materials relating to Johnson's activities as a land agent for his uncle Sir Peter Warren. Johnson acted as Warren's agent shortly after his immigration to America and managed Warren's Mohawk Valley lands. The collection was badly damaged in the 1911 New York State Capitol fire.

General Drummond, thanking troops and militia for their gallantry at the battle of Lundy's Lane. He offers particular admiration for the efforts of several regiments (89th Regiment, 41st Light Company, detachments of the 8th or King’s regiments, 104th regiment and the incorporated militia - 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th Lincoln and 2nd York, etc). This section is signed by Lieut. - Colonel J. Harvey, the Deputy Adjutant General, in July 1814 at the Head Quarters Falls of Niagara. The document also includes a list of officers killed, wounded and missing including Lt. mcdougal who is recorded as \"mortally\" wounded. It also lists the officers taken prisoner. This section was signed by E. Baynes, the Adjutant General. A transcript of the document follows; \"Head Quarters Falls of Niagara 26th July 1814 D.G. Order Lieutenant General Drummond offers his sincerest and warmest thanks to the Troops and Militia engaged Yesterday for their exemplary steadiness, gallantry, and discipline in repulsing all the efforts of a numerous and determined Enemy to carry the Position of Lundy's Lane near the Falls of Niagara. Their exertions have been crowned with complete Success by the defeat of the Enemy, and his retreat to the Position of Chippawa with the loss of 2 of his Guns and an immence(sic) number of felled and wounded and several hundred Prisoners. When all have behaved nobly, it is unnecessary to hold up particular instances of merit in Corps or Individuals. The Lieutenant General cannot however refrain from expressing in the strongest manner his admiration of the gallantry and Steadiness of the 89th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Morison, and Major Clifford who ably and Gallantly supported the Lieutenant Colonel's place after he was wounded; 41st Light Company under Captain Glen, and detachments of the 8th or King's Regiments under Captain Campbell; and Royals acting with them, also a party of Incorporated Militia by whom the brunt of the action was for a considerable time sustained and whose loss has been severe To the advance under Lieutenant Colonel Pearson consisting og the Glengarry Light Infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Battusby; a small aprty of the 104th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Drummond; the Incorporated Militia under Lieutenant Colonel Robinson; and the detachment from the 1st, 2nd,4th, and 5th Lincoln Militia and 2nd York, under Lieutenant Colonel Perry, 103rd Regiment; the Lieutenant General offers his warmest thanks. They are also due to the Troops which arrived under Colonel Scott during the action. Viz. the 1st Royal Scotts under Lieutenant Colonel Gorden; 8th Kings under Major Evinus 103rd Regiment under Colonel Scott, Flank(?) Company 104, with the Norfolk, Oxford, Kent, and Essex Rangers, and Middlesex, under Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton. The admirable steadiness and good conduct of the 19th Light Dragoons under Major Lisle and of the detachment of Royal Artillery under Captain McLaughlin and entitled to particular praise. The latter officer having been badly wounded, the Command of the Artillery devolved to Captain Mackinoche, with whose gallantry and exertions Lieutenant General Drummond was highly pleased. Sergeant Austin who directed the firing of the Congrave Rockets deserves very great credit. To the Officers of the General, and of his personal Staff, To Captain Holland Aid-de-Camp, to Major General Riall Lieutenant General Drummond feels himself greatly indebted for the assistance they afforded him. He has to lament being deprived by a wound early in the action of the services of Major General Riall who was most unfortunately made a prisoner whilst returning from the field by a party of the enemy Cavlary who had a momentary possession of the Road. Lieutenant General Drummond has also to regret the wound which has deprived the Corps of Services of Lieutenant Colonel Morrison 89th Regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Robinson of the Incorporated Militia. In the fall of Lieutenant Morrison of the 104th Regiment serving as deputy Assistant Adjutant General the Service has lost a gallant, intelligent, and meritorious young officer. The Lieutenant General and President has great pleasure in dismissing to their homes the whole of the Sedentary Militia who have so handsomely come forward on the occasion, confident that on any future emergency, their Loyalty will be again equally conspicuous. He will perform a grateful duty in representing to His Majesty's Governement the zeal, bravery and alacrity with which the Militia have co-operated with his Majesty's Troops. Signed J. Harvey, Lieut.

The original form of the building remains with the centre chimney stack in place. It was used as a school by Miss Young around 1825, believed to be closer to a private tutorship. The drawing was done from King St. looking south-east towards the house.\n\nJohn G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949.

Ration Book 6 was issued in Canada September 1946. The books were issued to allow the holder to submit coupons in order to purchase commodities. During World War 2 there were 11 million ration books issued to Canadians. Book 3 and 4 had coloured coupons for tea and coffee, sugar, butter, meat and misc. Book 5 and book 6 had letters on the coupons, B, S, M, Y, V, and X.\nRationing is a form of controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services. The theory is to allow each individual a portion of the scarce resource which is being distributed over a specific time period. It is used to control resource pricing through manipulating supply and demand and tries to reduce the spread of a black market. Rationing is generally unpopular, usually issued during wartime.","Subjects":"Ration Book 6\nWorld War 2\nWorld War II\nWWII\nWartime Prices and Trade Board","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/068/thumbs/199801406.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/068/thumbs/199801406-2.jpg"]},{"Id":"56465D41-E0FE-4560-BC61-893893288512","Name":"Booklet:Report","Object ID":"995.5.031","Date":"1942","Description":"Auditors' Report of the Town of Niagara for the Year of 1942.\nDetails for Receipts-General Account $142,816.45.\nExpenditure-General Account $142,816.45.\nAlso details of general expense, Assets, Liabilities for General Account.\nSeparate Waterworks, Public Liabrary, Board of Education, Hydro Commission receipts, expenditure, assets and liabilities.","Subjects":"Town of Niagara Financial Statements and Auditors' Report for the Year Ending December 31st, 1942.","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9955031.jpg"]},{"Id":"53F38E25-CA29-4BD9-AC78-561563274684","Name":"Affidavit","Object ID":"2006.010.037","Date":"18 March 1868","Description":"An affidavit by Peter McCarthy confirming information regarding a mortgager and his wife.","Relation":"Show Related Records...","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/072/thumbs/2006010037.jpg"]},{"Id":"369297C2-D4A6-4448-94D6-671826562135","Name":"Plan","Object ID":"2002.044.019","Title":"Plan","Date":"March 1875","Dimensions":"45.5 x 31.3 cm","Description":"Copy of part of Office Plan No 15.

It was written during his journeys to the Canadian and American West. (1864-65).\n\nTopics discussed in the letter include:\nBlake writes of his concern for his uncle John's cough. He says John should visit him as the is a pure water establishment, \"something like the Stevenson House\". Blake mentions his children, Herb and Ada. He talks of the extreme hot weather, 104 in the shade at the time of writing. Blake writes about unloading self loading rifles sent by Clark(?) from Washington. These rifles shoot 16 times without taking them from the shoulder. They are as accurate as those used in Canada and much handsomer. Blake saw a large lot of Buffalo skins come in from the praries and he wished he'd been among them with one of those riles.\n\nHe writes of Mrs. Cittenden and family enjoying their visit to the farm. He is sorry that Deal Smith is in poor health and says that she should be taking lots of ale and porter. He writes that he is pleased that the stone has been put up but wishes he knew what the freight and charges were. (Assume this stone is for Blake's first wife, Gertrude who died in 1863)\nHe mentions that he does not know why his uncle Sam Stocking has visited his mother and children again. Blake writes about the place he is in that, the only thing to do is buy land and raise stock. Blake is concerned that Sam Stocking should \"sell the milk so I can get my money\". Blake writes that he needs the money so he can send some to his mother to buy shoes for Mary. He suggests that the shoes be bought at Welsh's on credit. Clark has arrived and Blake and Clark will be starting out very soon. He says that his mother should write to him every week and it will be forwarded to him. Blake says that he will not have any chance to write to her. Blake tells his mother that he does not intend to go into the army. Blake says that Aunt Sally says Aunt Liddy's cancer is better. Aunt Sally wants Uncle John to come to Roscoe. He can go from Buffalo to Chicago on a steam boat for $9.00 U.S. and from there to Roscoe for 2 or 3 dollars. Blake talks of Clark getting the Rail Road going and if it succeeds it will open up a large tract of country. He then writes about how expensive everything is, as compared to Buffalo. He writes about his children's health. He asks that his uncle give his regards to Henderson and Milloy. He then talks about the deer and prairie chickens that are so plentiful for shooting. He says he could fill the whole of Niagara with deer and chickens by himself. He complains that he is not getting replies to his letters. He asks that Agg take good care of Phils (his dog). He says the dog would be of great value to min and if he came again he would bring him even if it cost $100.00. Prices for dogs are #50 - $100 and they sell quickly.","People":"Blake, John Alexander\nBlake, Mary Ann (nee Rogers)\nBlake, Herbert Rogers\nStocking, Sam\n","Subjects":"American West","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b).jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b)-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b)-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/067/thumbs/2011031241(a_b)-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"420A7A0C-BF96-4D58-AAF6-989702805392","Name":"Bookplate","Object ID":"989.5.575.9","Dimensions":"15 x 24 cm","Description":"A photograph of the side-paddle wheeler Chicora (1864-1913).

It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long. The club house was the former Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.","Subjects":"Golf\nFort Mississauga\nQueen's Royal Hotel\nFort George Golf Course\nFort Mississauga Golf Course\nRecreation and Leisure\nSports\nGolfing","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"AD868194-94BC-441C-AF51-900507674455","Name":"Certificate","Object ID":"2015.021.023","Title":"Canadian Overseas Expedionary Forces, Discharge Certificate","Date":"09/08/1917","Dimensions":"20 cm x 23 cm","Description":"This is a discharge certificate from the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Forces for John William Jackson.

After being in business for a few years in Dundas, he moved to the village of Queenston in Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1823. Here he became known as a bookseller, grocer, haberdasher, and druggist. Records don't seem to indicate what piqued his interest in politics or the desire to start his newspaper, The Colonial Advocate, but in 1824 he launched his first issue from his home and business in Queenston. The Colonial Advocate was dedicated to political and social reform and promoted responsible government and opposition to the current colonial governing practices that ruled Upper Canada at the time. Mackenzie had been editing his newspaper in the village for about three months, when he decided to lure Hiram Leavenworth, along with his press, printing materials, and typeset to Queenston, to manage the printing on his behalf. Before this, Mackenzie had his bi-weekly paper printed in Lewiston. This document is an agreement between Leavenworth and Mackenzie for the duties, salary, and equipment purchased to begin his Queenston operation. Within one month, Mackenzie's print shop was in full operation in his home, located at 1 Queenston Street. After producing around 20 issues, Mackenzie left Queenston for York (Toronto) in the fall of 1824, and he continued printing his newspaper there. This move was ultimately made from his desire to make a difference politically-and did he ever! He became a Member of the Legislative Assembly, but he caused so many issues that he was kicked and elected back in four times! In 1834, the Reformers won a majority on the newly created Toronto City Council, and Mackenzie was elected Toronto's first Mayor. When he was defeated at the polls in 1836, he became very resentful. This is when he began planning the Upper Canada Rebellion, which took place in December of 1837. This rebellion was put down quite quickly, due to poor planning and lack of military experience from the individuals involved. Since his involvement in this insurrection was considered treasonous, there was a warrant out for his capture and arrest. Mackenzie fled from Toronto to the United States. He tried to continue to lead his rebellion from Navy Island located on the Niagara River. Here he organized his own provisional government, and he was able to obtain money and weapons from supporters and sympathizers. The British Military wasn't going to let him off easy. They bombarded Navy Island with cannon fire. Eventually, he and his supporters abandoned the island. Despite the failed rebellion in 1837, Mackenzie was able to spark a flame in many who believed in his democratic ideals. His newspaper, The Colonial Advocate, which started in Queenston, was part of this movement and it helped to sew the seeds of rebellion.","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/9875082.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/9875082-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/9875082-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/9875082-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"5A5A3572-4DD1-4297-AEB5-471679498442","Name":"Article","Object ID":"2011.031.012","Title":"A Remarkable Case of Healing - letter from John C Schooley, New York","Date":"27/03/1893","Description":"An article titled: \"A Remarkable Case of Healing\" published by the Christian Science Tract.

In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course.

Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer.\nWhen the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year.\nThe recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.\nWhen asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. \"I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare\" said the Colonel. \"My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.\"\nWindeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going.

He was the 3rd son of Darius and Rebecca Williams, of ‘Welch’ descent. Benajah settled on 100 acres in Niagara in 1795, with an additional 100 acres added in 1796. I presume these were the tracts described in the land grant? Subsequently in 1805 he moved to Glen Williams where he established a mill in the Credit river. The Stamford survey of 1813, which must have been a hazardous survey given the war in Niagara that year, shows that he owned only 1 of the 2 acreages at that time. Benajah was married three times and had 9 children. He died in Glen Williams in 1851. His family continues to own the mill until late in the 1800’s when it was sold to the Beaumonts.\n\nTranscript reads: \"GEORGE the THIRD by the Grace of GOD, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.

General Drummond, thanking troops and militia for their gallantry at the battle of Lundy's Lane. He offers particular admiration for the efforts of several regiments (89th Regiment, 41st Light Company, detachments of the 8th or King’s regiments, 104th regiment and the incorporated militia - 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th Lincoln and 2nd York, etc). This section is signed by Lieut. - Colonel J. Harvey, the Deputy Adjutant General, in July 1814 at the Head Quarters Falls of Niagara. The document also includes a list of officers killed, wounded and missing including Lt. mcdougal who is recorded as \"mortally\" wounded. It also lists the officers taken prisoner. This section was signed by E. Baynes, the Adjutant General. A transcript of the document follows; \"Head Quarters Falls of Niagara 26th July 1814 D.G. Order Lieutenant General Drummond offers his sincerest and warmest thanks to the Troops and Militia engaged Yesterday for their exemplary steadiness, gallantry, and discipline in repulsing all the efforts of a numerous and determined Enemy to carry the Position of Lundy's Lane near the Falls of Niagara. Their exertions have been crowned with complete Success by the defeat of the Enemy, and his retreat to the Position of Chippawa with the loss of 2 of his Guns and an immence(sic) number of felled and wounded and several hundred Prisoners. When all have behaved nobly, it is unnecessary to hold up particular instances of merit in Corps or Individuals. The Lieutenant General cannot however refrain from expressing in the strongest manner his admiration of the gallantry and Steadiness of the 89th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Morison, and Major Clifford who ably and Gallantly supported the Lieutenant Colonel's place after he was wounded; 41st Light Company under Captain Glen, and detachments of the 8th or King's Regiments under Captain Campbell; and Royals acting with them, also a party of Incorporated Militia by whom the brunt of the action was for a considerable time sustained and whose loss has been severe To the advance under Lieutenant Colonel Pearson consisting og the Glengarry Light Infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Battusby; a small aprty of the 104th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Drummond; the Incorporated Militia under Lieutenant Colonel Robinson; and the detachment from the 1st, 2nd,4th, and 5th Lincoln Militia and 2nd York, under Lieutenant Colonel Perry, 103rd Regiment; the Lieutenant General offers his warmest thanks. They are also due to the Troops which arrived under Colonel Scott during the action. Viz. the 1st Royal Scotts under Lieutenant Colonel Gorden; 8th Kings under Major Evinus 103rd Regiment under Colonel Scott, Flank(?) Company 104, with the Norfolk, Oxford, Kent, and Essex Rangers, and Middlesex, under Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton. The admirable steadiness and good conduct of the 19th Light Dragoons under Major Lisle and of the detachment of Royal Artillery under Captain McLaughlin and entitled to particular praise. The latter officer having been badly wounded, the Command of the Artillery devolved to Captain Mackinoche, with whose gallantry and exertions Lieutenant General Drummond was highly pleased. Sergeant Austin who directed the firing of the Congrave Rockets deserves very great credit. To the Officers of the General, and of his personal Staff, To Captain Holland Aid-de-Camp, to Major General Riall Lieutenant General Drummond feels himself greatly indebted for the assistance they afforded him. He has to lament being deprived by a wound early in the action of the services of Major General Riall who was most unfortunately made a prisoner whilst returning from the field by a party of the enemy Cavlary who had a momentary possession of the Road. Lieutenant General Drummond has also to regret the wound which has deprived the Corps of Services of Lieutenant Colonel Morrison 89th Regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Robinson of the Incorporated Militia. In the fall of Lieutenant Morrison of the 104th Regiment serving as deputy Assistant Adjutant General the Service has lost a gallant, intelligent, and meritorious young officer. The Lieutenant General and President has great pleasure in dismissing to their homes the whole of the Sedentary Militia who have so handsomely come forward on the occasion, confident that on any future emergency, their Loyalty will be again equally conspicuous. He will perform a grateful duty in representing to His Majesty's Governement the zeal, bravery and alacrity with which the Militia have co-operated with his Majesty's Troops. Signed J. Harvey, Lieut.

John Butler, who died in 1796, but does have a historical connection to his family. It was moved here from its original site near present-day Balmoral Dr. (just off Mississauga St., south of Anne St.) It may have incorporated a part of the house which Col. Butler did occupy, which was on the same piece of land as this one. Col. Butler's house is marked on Andrew Gray's 1810 plan of the town near the 2-mile Creek - a cairn marks this spot today. This was outside the boundaries of the original town survey, and thus not one of the lots granted in the 1790s to loyalists. It was certainly one of the first surviving houses constructed in Niagara, but its origins are of some dispute.\nMost histories attribute the building of the house to James Butler, the brother of Col. John Butler. Col. Butler is an integral figure to the origins of Niagara, having brought together and commanded a group of loyalist soldiers from the Mohawk valley that played a large role in the American Revolution. The Rangers disbanded in 1784 to Fort Niagara, which had been used as their base. Butler moved across the river with a number of families soon after that to start a farming settlement to provide food for Fort Niagara. In 1796, after Fort Niagara was finally ceded to the Americans, the remainder of the Rangers and loyalists moved across, and many of these families and their children were granted land in the town of Niagara. Col. Butler, and much of his family, are buried in Butler's Burying Ground, at the end of Butler St.\n1815-1816 is generally thought to be the building date of the house, but there is some possibility the house was built prior to the War of 1812 and survived - it may have been overlooked by those burning the town in 1813 because of its location outside the town boundaries. Janet Carnochan's History of Niagara, states that it was called the \"James Butler House,\" and that \"reliable evidence shows that it was there on the day of the Battle of Queenston Heights.\" There are also varying theories about the house's builder - it may have also been built by Ann Clement, the widow of Thomas Butler, Col. Butler's son. In the 1850s it was owned by another James Butler, the son of Thomas and Ann, who altered the front of the house in a Greek Revival style.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century the house was restored and moved to its current location. The house used to have another wing, probably added by James Butler in the 1850s, to accommodate his family, which has since been removed.","Subjects":"Butler House\n275 Simcoe Street","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/048/thumbs/9895428.jpg"]},{"Id":"64643AAE-6987-4CFD-8812-123816441543","Name":"Currency","Object ID":"991.1052","Date":"1859-NOV.01","Description":"Brantford (Green Issue).

G. Williams.\nThe Junior Commissariat Quarters is the oldest surviving building in the Butlers Barracks Complex, located near the west corner of King and John Street. It is a low verandahed cottage style building dated from 1817. The building began as a stable, then converted to a residence at the commissariat's insistance. Up to 1870 the occupants alternated between military and civilian tenants. For the next 40 years it was the commandants quarters for summer military camps, then used by the military for staff headquarters until the end of World War II. After the war it was transfered to the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake and used by various groups up until the Korean War when it was used by the military again. In 1966 the land and the buildings were transfered to Parks Canada and has been restored, on the exterior, to it's 1852 appearances.\nJohn G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949.

Many advertisements are included, of local interest is the Queen's Royal Hotel, B.L. Currie Boarding and Stables, Chautauqua Boat and Bath Houses, Niagara River Line, Wm McClelland West End Store and many other Toronto businesses.\n\nThe Chautauqua Hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake. It was representative of a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.\nChautauqua Hotel was built in 1887 and destroyed by fire Aug 25th, 1909. The hotel was built on land originally called Crookston. It was later purchased by the Niagara Assembly for a religious and intellectual summer resort. The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.\nThe grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.\nWith a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned down in 1909.","Subjects":"Niagara Assembly\nChautauqua Hotel\nQueen's Royal Hotel\nB.L.

In 1874 when the new church as purchased on Victoria Street the Meeting House was sold and moved to it's present location at Gate Street and Prideaux Street. Located at 155 Gate Street the renovated Meeting House has seen service as a candle factory and a pork packing plant. Eventually it was converted to a residence and known as the Wright House.\n\nThe church on Victoria Street was built in 1852, designed by William Thomas, who is also responsible for the design of the current Courthouse on Queen Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake and Brock's Monument in Queenston. It was originally called the Victoria Street Methodist Church. The building is predominately 'Romanesque' and is one of only three smaller churches designed by William Thomas that are still in existence today. In 1925 when the United Church came into existence the church was renamed Grace United Church.","People":"Thomas, William\n","Subjects":"Grace United Church\nCemetery\nGraveyard","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/068/thumbs/2011019001.jpg"]},{"Id":"950AB132-DBC6-483A-97A1-178424652903","Name":"Bill","Object ID":"995.140","Date":"JAN 11, 1943","Description":"Account statement from George A.

Blake in partition proceedings brought by Agnes McFarland regarding Lot #52.\n\nTranscription is as follows:\n\nOntario Country of York\nIn the matter of lot Number 52 in the Town of Niagara on the Lake in the County of Lincoln.\nTo wit:\nI, James Richardson Roaf in the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, Solicitor, do Solemnly declare:\n(1) That I acted as solicitor for the Defendants John A. Blake and Gertrude L. Blake in the partition proceedings brought by one Agnes McFarland for the sale or partition of the above mentioned lot and in teh course of the said proceedings I had to make enquiries about the family of the said John A. Blake and the said Agnes McFarland and the different interests in connection with the said property.\n(2) I found that John Rogers and Mary Rogers subsequently Mary Blake, were brother and sister and that the name of their mother was Agnes Rogers and I believe that the said M. Blake the grantor in the deed of Bargain and sale dated the 4th of December 1835 was the same person as Mary Rogers the grantee in the patent dated the 15th of July 1830.\n(3) That the said John Rogers was an unmarried man until he was comparatively well on in the years when he married, his wife also being an Agnes Rogers and the said John Rogers when he deceased died interstate leaving him surviving his widow Eliza Ann Rogers and one child Ada Rogers the said John Rogers not having married until the later part of the 19th century and somewhere about the year 1875.\n(4) That the said property was apparently divided into two parcels (a) On the corner a small portion about 1/7 of an acre upon which was erected two stone stores. (b) The remainder of the said lot upon which was erected a dwelling house which together with the garden surrounded the portion (a) The said dwelling house was occupied by the said Agnes Rogers, mother of John Rogers, and with her lived her son John Rogers and her daughter Mary Blake who had become a widow, and John A. Blake and Agnes McFarland two chuldren of the said Mary Blake. On or about December the 24th 1835 the whole of the said property became vested in the said John Rogers who on the 25th day of January 1836 made a mortgage of the residence and a portion of the said property being parcel (b) above mentioned, to this mother Agnes Rogers to secure an annuity of 25 pounds a year.\n(5) The said Agnes Rogers subsequently died leaving a will bearing date on or about the 2nd day of April 1862, which will was duly probated and subsequently registered in the registry office of the county of Lincoln as number 12624 whereb shedivised the property for life to her daughter Mary Ann Blake (the above called Mary Blake) with remainder equally between the said Mary Ann Blake, Agnes McFarland and John A. Blake they being the daughter and two of the grandchildren of the said Agnes Rogers. The said Mary Ann Blake subsequently died leaving a will bearing date the 18th of May 1894 whereby she devised all her interest in the said property to her daughter Agnes McFarland who thereupon would be entitled to 2/3 interest or share in the whole property and brought petition proceedings for sale of the said property.\n(6) In the said proceedings I raised the question that a mortgage having been made by John Rogers to his Mother Agnes Rogers of about 2/3 of the said lot that the deed of quit claim bearing date Sugust 11th 1857 made by the said John Rogers to the said Agnes Rogers a title to the portion of the lands which had not been mortgaged to her and that the said John Rogers or his representative the same being his widow Agnes Rogers and his daughter Ada Rogers might be entitled to a portion of the said property. The said partition proceeding came on for trial at St. Catharines on the 29th day of May 1899 and the Judge the Honourable W.R. Merredith reserved Judgment and after considering the matter and by consent the said Agnes Rogers the widow and Ada Rogers the only daughter of the said John Rogers were added as parties to the said partition proceedings and the proceedings were subsequently continued and in time a sale of the said property was made to Herbert R. Blake and by vesting order made on or about the 4th of July 1902, the interest of Agnes McFarland, John A. Blake, Gertrude L. Blake, to whom the said John A. Blake had conveyed his interest, Agnes Rogers and Ada Rogers were vested in the said H.R. Blake.\n(7) I also found that the said Blake family and their mother Agnes Rogers and John Rogers had been continually in possession of the said property since about the year 1835 and that no claim could be found adverse to them though the said John Rogers and Mary Ann Blake had given some mortgages which had been held by the Niagara District Building Society but that the said mortgages had been handed over to the said Mary Ann Blake and the same had been paid off and no claim had been made or could be made against the interest of the said parties to teh said partition proceedings.\nAND I make this solemn Delcaration conscientiously believing it to be true, and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath by the virtue of \"The Canada Evidence Act, 1893.\"\nDeclared before me at the City of Toronto in the County of York this first day of February A.D. 1904\n(no name signed)\nA Commissioner &c.","People":"Blake, Herbert Rogers\nBlake, John Alexander\nMerredith, W.R.\nRichardson, James\nRogers, Ada\nRogers, Agnes\nRogers, Eliza Ann\nRogers, John\nMcFarland, Agnes\nBlake, Mary Ann (nee Rogers)\n","Subjects":"Lot 52\nNiagara-on-the-Lake\nLincoln County","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2011031214 (ac).jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2011031214 (ac)-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2011031214 (ac)-3.jpg"]},{"Id":"6F16D7AD-7A33-4013-9266-461249444376","Name":"Booklet","Object ID":"987.5.4.129","Date":"1910 C.","Description":"A holiday gift guidebook published by Philip Librock's store which was located at 12 and 14 Queen Street.

In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course.

Hamilton dated at St. David's to his aunt Mrs. Henderson in Edinburgh regarding the War of 1812.\n\nTranscription is as follows:\n\nThis letter was written in the year of 1813, and addressed to Mrs. Henderson, No. 1, Park Street, Edinburgh. The original bears the stamp of \"Ship Letter\" per \"Mary\".\n\nSt. Davids, July 4, 1813\n\nMy dear Aunt,\nYour last kind letter of the first April, together with the large packet from the boys, came to hand last evening and gave us infinite pleasure. I can easily conceive how anxious you must be to hear from this as such a time, but I assure you that it is almost impossible either to write or to get letters from this when written: this must in some measure excuse our long silence. Many changes of fortune have occured since the commencement of the war, but we are still, thank God, able to keep our heads up, and things at this moment appear again in our favour.\nThe first appearances were rather against us; General Hull of the Americans, crossed the river at Detroit and planted their standard, but short was their triumph. Our gallant General Brock attacked them with a handful of troops, drove them from their entrenchments, and in our turn crossed the river, took possesion of Fort Detroit, when the whole garrison - 2,500 men - as also the territory of Michigan, surrendered to our arms. Brock returned amidst the acclamations of an almost idolizing public.\nTheir next attempt was at Fort Erie. From the great extent of our lines of defence, from Fort Erie to Niagara - 35 miles - with scarcely 1000 regular troops, you may suppose how weak our Guards were. They attacked us in the middle of the night with 500 picked men, sailors, and I am sorry to say most of them our own countrymen, surrounded our small guards and murdered them without mercy, and took possession of three of our batteries - but again their reign was short. Day dawned - the remainder of our small collected and drove them with precipitations into their boats, and took their commander officer and fifty men. This was nothing - our danger only now appeared approaching. An incredible number of boats were drawn up along the opposing shore, the troops all embarked - 5000 men. A few well directed shots from our field pieces, and the alacrity of our re-enforcements, coming in every minute, made them first pause and at last entirely relinquish their plan. Their troops were disembarked and their boats taken as far as possible out of he range of our shots.\nThe business of Queenston you already know; they were again defeated with astonishing loss - one General, two or three Cols., 50 or 60 inferior Officers and 1000 men. General Winchester next fell into our hands in approaching Fort Detroit with 450 men. The command then devolved on General Harrison, who was shortly after attacked by General Proctor, and his Fort on the Miamis invested.\nA re-enforcement of 1300 men attempted to find their way through our lines to the Fort, in which they succeeded with loss, however, of 500 men taken prisoners.\nThe next appeared on Lake Ontario, with 17 sail of vessels for an attack on York, in which they succeeded with the loss of General Pike, and between three and four hundred men killed, principally killed by the blowing up of our magazine before our retreat, but as if a species of fatality still pursued them, they became afraid of an attack from our Indians and troops. After destroying all the public property they could find, decamped in a few days - took bag and baggage. They then proceeded for Fort George, where from internal enemies, having gained every intelligence of our plan of defence, everything seemed now in their favor. An astonishing thick fog having spread itself over the whole river and lake, by which means they were enabled to place every vessal and boat exactly where they wished them, without our being to annoy them in the least, or even knowing where they were. When the weather cleared up we found ourselves surrounded with boats and vessels on every side. They approached us with boats divisions, each division of which was stronger than our whole force put together. Notwithstanding this fearful odds, our advanced Guards received them at the point of their bayonet, and in several instances forced them again into their boats. Not content with attacking us with their men, they now opened a most destructive fire of grape and cannister from their vessels. Though the action lasted scarecely three-quarters of an hour, out of 500 brave fellows who entered the field, scarcely 200 returned.\nFinding further resistance quite in vain, our General Vincent, with tears in his eyes, gave the neccessary orders for a retreat, which, in spite of six times our numbers within a few hundred yards of us, was effected without the loss of a single man.\nWe then proceecded to the head of the lake and took up a strong position at that place - our whole force consisting of about 2000 men. They after determined attacking us with 5000 men, two divisions, the first of 3000 arrived within five miles of us, at a place called Stoney Creek, the other within a few miles of them. Having intelligence from a deserter of their intention to attack us early next morning with their whole force, General Vincent called together his Officers, when it was determined to be before hand with them, and attack their front division that night. 800 of our best troops were chosen for this attack, drove them with the bayonet from their position, got possession of three field pieces, and took their two Generals Windsor and Chandler prisoners. They immediately fell back on their rear division, and the whole were making the best of their way to their boats on the lake, when to the astonishment of everybody six vessels appeared in sight under American Colors. They planted the standard on the bank, and gave them three cheers, when suddenly the colors were shifted, and the royal standard was seen flying on the vessel, which together with a few well-directed shots put them into such a condition that they decamped with the utmost precipitation, leaving everything in our hands - 19 boats - with the whole of their tents and camp equipage. They never stopped until they reached Fort George. We followed them in a day or two as far as the Beaver Dams, about 18 miles from their Fort. They determined upon attacking us there, but from our intelligence we were again beforehand with them with 420 men.\nWe were not within a few miles of Fort George. Our troops are every hour advancing, and we are fully determined, although their force is still greatly superior to ours, to make one gallant attempt to drive them from our shores, trusting to that Divine Providence which has hitherto so strongly upheld us. We have no fears. I shall not seal this until we know the events.\nRobert went up last winter with Mr. Robert Dickson to bring down for our support the North Western Indians, and is expected back every day. Some of the Indians have already arrived. George and myself with Mr. Robertson are attached to Col. DeHearn of the 104th Regiment, who commands the advanced Guards, from our knowledge of the country and roats about the place, to assist him in his movements, etc.\nJames is attached as a Lieutentant to the Incorporative Militia, and is stationed a mile or two from this. It is with the utmsot pleasure, I say, that although one or other of us, sometimes two or three together, have been in almost every action that has taken place, yet that not one of our friends have been hurt. Mr. and Mrs. Clark, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. and Mr. Tom Dickson are all well, the last you will be happy to hear has a daughter, a few days ago, as likewise Mrs. Robert Hamilton, Mrs. C.H. and Son are at York with their friends, both very well. Mr. Robert Murray is still on the American Shore at Presque Isle. We have not heard from him since the commencement of the war, but as he has no hand in this it is to be hoped he will be allowed to remain quietly at home and mind his business.\nThe Americans, upon taking possession of Niagara, allowed the inhabitants to remain in quiet possession of their homes and property, but since their last adverse fortune they have taken up almost every gentlement of respectability and sent them over the river as prisoners of war.\nYou will be sorry to hear Mr. Wm. Dickson is among the number. Mr. T. Dickson had to make his escape in the night. John Robertson, you will be pleased to hear has behaved himself with great propriety, and proved himself a most gallant soldier. His wife and daughter are both well. Owing to a chance in councils at Headquarters, it is determiend that no attack shall be made upon Fort George untill the vessels shall have decided the command of the lakes. James intends writing you after the attack is made. I shall leave it, therefore, to him to give you, I hope good news.\nRemember me most affectionately to all my friends with you and believe me my dear Aunt,\nMost sincerely yours,\nA.

Broeck, in command the 4th Regiment of Lincoln Militia, on May 2, 1813, enclosing a Militia District Order. Ten Broeck was instructed to \"make known to the officers non Commissioned Officers & Privates\" of the 4th Lincoln the contents of the District Order. This is 3 weeks before the Battle of Fort George.\n\nThe District Order referred to has not yet been located. However, news of the Capture of York on April 27th had reached Fort George at 1:00 a.m. on April 29 and it is suspected that this District Order was related to that event. Brigadier General John Vincent, in command at Fort George, expected the next American move to be an attack on the Head of the Lake to secure the position at Burlington Heights, thereby threatening British communications with the Grand River by cutting the overland route from Burlington Bay to the interior. He expected that the Americans would then attack Fort George in a pincer movement across the Niagara River and from the Burlington vicinity. Following the American capture of York, many of the militiamen of York District had sought out the Americans to offer their \"paroles,\" promises to not fight against the Americans in exchange for their freedom to go about their civilian activities unhindered. The District Order sent to Ten Broeck may have been to remind the Lincoln Militia of their duty and to warn them to be prepared to be called up, pending further American action.\n\nTranscript is \"Fort George 2nd May 1813 Sir I have the honor to enclose for you information a copy of the Militia D.

G. Williams dated 1956.\nAlso known as Cameron-Farren House or Cameron Cottage. Built in 1817 it is a single storey home with archaded detail similiar to the \"Western Home for Girls\" located near by. The home was originally built for the Widow Cameron and is an example of a Neo-Classic Georgian Cottage. An expansion in the back was added in 1860 which included a summer kitchen. In 1871 the building was purchased by Mrs Rye's Western Home for Girl's. The Western Home was in operation from 1869 thru 1895 when the institution was transfered to the Church of England Waife and Stray's Society which stayed in operation until 1913. The main Western Home was demolisted around 1914. The cottage was used by the Polish Army during WWI while training at Niagara Camp. A long period of dereliction left only the cottage portion of the house remaining. The current owner has done extensive restoration which includes a new addition to the back of the original cottage. The house is located at 708 King Street. The perspective is from the corner of King and Cottage Street, facing south-east.\n\nJohn G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949. The sketches in the collection of the Niagara Historical museum we completed in the 1950's. John G. Williams died in 1960.","People":"Cameron, Widow\nWilliams, John G.\n","Subjects":"Cameron-Farren House\nCameron Cottage\nWestern Home for Girls\nPolish Soldiers\nNiagara Camp\nFirst World War","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/020/thumbs/991094.jpg"]},{"Id":"755241BA-CF7E-453E-874F-024822553480","Name":"Indenture","Object ID":"982.306.132","Date":"1881-AUG.22","Description":"An indenture and Land Deed tranferring the possession of four acres in the Town of Woodstock from a Francis Ramsey Ball, to Isabel Johnson Ball.

One was the first jail and court house in the present area of King and Prideaux Streets. But by 1815 the war was over. Law and order needed to be maintained and a new jail and court house were required.\nIt was to be built on land in the present Rye, Niagara and Charlotte Street area, donated by William Dickson, the noted local lawyer and politician. It would be out of the range of cannon fire from Fort Niagara, for sure, but Dickson, who owned other land in the area, would have probably seen the potential of a new public building leading to development on his other lands, even though a contemporary observer wondered, in 1818, why such a magnificent building was set in a \"swamp\".\nThe courthouse was the seat of justice in Niagara from 1816 until the late 1860's. A number of key trials took place here, including that of reformer Robert Gourlay in 1819, as well as one for thirteen 1837 rebels who were condemned to death (most of whom were reprieved), along with those of a further assortment of debtors, horse thieves, murderers, and the like. The jail staged many executions, floggings, placing in the pillory and, of course, it housed many convicted (and accused) criminals.\nIn 1869 after a new courthouse was erected on Queen Street in the Town, the building was purchased by Maria Rye and renamed \"Our Western Home\", a home for young girls from England who it was believed in the view of time, has a better chance for a good life in Canada than in the orphanages or amongst the poor families in England. Its use changed over time and it was finally demolished in the 1970's. Its location marked by an Ontario Heritage Trust plaque.\nThis 1815 warrant, which prescribed the construction of the building, is an important document not just for scholars of the history of early Ontario, but for those who are interested in the history, indeed legal history, of Niagara.","People":"McGill, John\nSymington, John\nMacMahon, Edward\nRobinson, Fredrick Phillips\n","Subjects":"Court House\nCourthouse\nGaol\nRye Home\nOur Western Home\nKing Street\nReceiver General of Upper Canada","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/002/thumbs/2002060001.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/002/thumbs/2002060001-2.jpg"]},{"Id":"AFD39EF2-00F1-4FF3-90F1-135997330680","Name":"Letter","Object ID":"978.523.36","Date":"March 5, 1968","Dimensions":"20 X 25 CM","Description":"One of the tasks of the Niagara Branch Women's Institute's Secretary Treasurer, Mrs. C.J.

The latter officer having been badly wounded, the Command of the Artillery devolved to Captain Mackinoche, with whose gallantry and exertions Lieutenant General Drummond was highly pleased. Sergeant Austin who directed the firing of the Congrave Rockets deserves very great credit. To the Officers of the General, and of his personal Staff, To Captain Holland Aid-de-Camp, to Major General Riall Lieutenant General Drummond feels himself greatly indebted for the assistance they afforded him. He has to lament being deprived by a wound early in the action of the services of Major General Riall who was most unfortunately made a prisoner whilst returning from the field by a party of the enemy Cavlary who had a momentary possession of the Road. Lieutenant General Drummond has also to regret the wound which has deprived the Corps of Services of Lieutenant Colonel Morrison 89th Regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Robinson of the Incorporated Militia. In the fall of Lieutenant Morrison of the 104th Regiment serving as deputy Assistant Adjutant General the Service has lost a gallant, intelligent, and meritorious young officer. The Lieutenant General and President has great pleasure in dismissing to their homes the whole of the Sedentary Militia who have so handsomely come forward on the occasion, confident that on any future emergency, their Loyalty will be again equally conspicuous. He will perform a grateful duty in representing to His Majesty's Governement the zeal, bravery and alacrity with which the Militia have co-operated with his Majesty's Troops. Signed J. Harvey, Lieut.

The first class hotel became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930.\nThere were many activities avaliable at the hotel for guests including fishing, golf, tennis, lawn bowling, a bathing beach, an orchestra.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long. The club house was the former Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.","Subjects":"Fort George Golf Course\nFort Mississauga Golf Course\nRecreation and Leisure\nSports\nGolfing","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852045.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852045-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852045-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852045-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"B9D3EE74-D1B5-483D-A283-982719120018","Name":"Bylaws","Object ID":"978.189","Date":"ca. 1850s","Dimensions":"40 x 32 cm\nfolded to 20 x 32 cm","Description":"This document is a list of the Rules and Regulations of the Niagara Fire Company.","People":"Botsford, David\nClement, John Jr.\nCrooks, John Y.\nClement, Joseph B.\nClement, Ralfe M.\nClench, Johnson\nDavidson, John\nFagan, Patrick\nFields, Robert\nGraham, John\nGrier, John\nHarris, John\nHarris, William\nHawley, Adam\nHeron, Andrew Jr.\nHarvey, Ursen\nHoward, Richard\nJones, John\nMartindale, John Jr.\nMcBride, John\nMcBride, James\nMcNally, Hugh\nMiller, William\nMiller, John\nRichardson, Thomas\nRogers, John\nRogers, James\nStewart, William\nVarey, George\nWagstaff, Richard\nWagstaff, James\nWagstaff, John Jr.\nWelch, Simon\nBarker, John\n","Subjects":"Niagara Fire Company\nFirefighter\nbylaws","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/075/thumbs/978189.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/075/thumbs/978189-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/075/thumbs/978189-3.jpg"]},{"Id":"24CC309B-BD9F-44AF-9993-456134937700","Name":"Bill","Object ID":"995.148","Date":"Aug 21, 1940","Description":"Account statement from H.Reid & Son to Charles Taggert for amount due plus interest.","People":"Taggert, Charles\n","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/059/thumbs/995148.jpg"]},{"Id":"B60EDCA7-A6DC-4D42-87EC-817850268743","Name":"Letter","Object ID":"2015.030.051 A&B","Title":"Roy Greaves","Date":"02/04/1945","Dimensions":"A: 24 cm x 20.2 cm\n\nB: 23 cm x 10.5 cm","Description":"A letter from the R.C.A.F.

Clark was upset by this when he expected a full company of around 50 men to report for duty at Fort George and in effect threatened Major Ten Broeck. It was important to have the militia work on the fortifications at Fort George and new Fort Mississauga then under construction. Getting these places into a defensible shape was crucial, as was proven in July when the Americans invaded yet again and marched to the Town of Niagara following their victory at the Battle of Chippawa. The forts were sufficiently strong to prevent the Americans from attacking and recapturing Niagara.\nClark wrote that \"in future two companys (sic) will be required to serve for Seven days.\" He then stated that if more men did not readily respond when called out for duty then \"we will call for the whole Regiment and keep them out until the service required is performed.\" This goad undoubtedly spurred Ten Broeck to ensure that sufficient \"volunteers\" answered the call when required to prevent the whole regiment, every man between the ages of 16 to 60, from being forced to serve.\nThroughout the War of 1812, companies of normally around 50 militia men from the various regiments were called out by the British for active service for labour, to serve on guard duty, to transport supplies by wagon or bateau, to man sentry stations and, in dire emergencies, to fight alongside the British Regulars. Normally, these companies of men would be called out for relatively brief periods of time, a week or two normally, and would be relieved by another company. This ensured that the work was done while enabling the sedentary militia to carry on with their regular civilian pursuits. The provision of livestock and produce throughout the war was essential for feeding the troops on duty and the Native allies and their families.","People":"Clark, John\nTenBroeck, Jacob\n","Subjects":"War of 1812\nWar of 1812-14\nLincoln Militia\n4th Lincoln Militia","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/004/thumbs/2006036003.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/004/thumbs/2006036003-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/thumbs/2006036003-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/thumbs/2006036003-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"493E3FAA-A8BE-4D34-BC95-923518294319","Name":"Note","Object ID":"2009.027.235","Title":"Account with Josiah Hanniwell","Dimensions":"21 x 14 cm","Description":"This brief note is a record of 6 days of work that was completed by Josiah Hanniwell totalling $12.00.","People":"Hanniwell, Josiah\n","Relation":"Show Related Records...","Subjects":"Niagara Council\npay receipt","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/086/thumbs/2009027235.jpg"]},{"Id":"F581B94E-D964-4C39-8C74-211809663936","Name":"Programme","Object ID":"2006.022.025","Date":"March 9th,1910","Description":"Programme of an event in honour of the official visit of Right Worshipful Brother J.

Windeyer.\nRichard C. Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer.\nWhen the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year.\nThe recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.\nWhen asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. \"I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare\" said the Colonel. \"My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.\"\nWindeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long. The club house was the former Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.","Subjects":"Golf\nFort Mississauga\nQueen's Royal Hotel\nFort George Golf Course\nFort Mississauga Golf Course\nRecreation and Leisure\nSports\nGolfing","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885205-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"E39C2DF4-541D-4266-BAFB-288582678210","Name":"Register","Object ID":"982.318.40","Dimensions":"40 x 32.5 cm","Description":"This document lists the names of parents, how many children are enrolled in school and the amount of tuition owed per quarter for the parent/guardian to pay.","People":"Gonder, Michael Dunn\nBeam, John\nBaker, John\nPalmerton, Thomas\nShoup, Jacob\nGonder, George\nBeam, Abraham\nShoup, Martin\nWait, Amarilla\nBeam, Henry\nDanner, Joseph\nSmith, James\nMiller, Jacob\n","Relation":"Show Related Records...","Subjects":"tuition\nschool\nSchool Section","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/082/thumbs/98231840.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/082/thumbs/98231840-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/082/thumbs/98231840-3.jpg"]},{"Id":"AAD38F90-F43D-474C-849D-633846588604","Name":"Book","Object ID":"985.4.537(A&B)","Date":"1981","Dimensions":"21.5 X 28cm\n12 pages","Description":"A fundraising book that was used to obtain donations that would go towards the restoration of the Court House.

It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855.\n\nSometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a \"coloured\" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the \"Negro Burial Ground\".\n\nUnfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations. The births listed in 1849 are:\n\"George Hunter (?), daughter; January 22, 1849-Mary Matilda\n\"Mr. Samuel Graham of a son. Born Aug 18, 1849-William Henry\n\"Jack (?) Washington of a daughter.

G. Williams.\nThis home is also known as the Crysler-Rigg House. Built in 1822 it is a white clapboard, three bay designed, two storey home with a low pitched roof. The home was originally built by Ralph Morden Crysler, a wealthy merchant in town. The home was sold to lawyer Charles L. Hall in the late 1830s who added Greek Revival improvements in the 1840's. In the 1940's and 1950's the house was owned by Bruce Rigg, a local doctor, who did most of the landscaping on the property. The house is located at 187 Queen Street, and the perspective is from Queen Street, facing north towards the side and rear of the house.\n\nJohn G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949. The sketches in the collection of the Niagara Historical museum we completed in the 1950's. John G.

However, we understand that in the past the hotel management has not co-operated as freely as it might have done in the employment of help and also in regard to the purchase of supplies in the community. We wish to point out that we now have in our employment and actually woking at the Queens 25 men and women, all of whom are from Niagara. We wish also to point out the fact that all supplies neccessary for beginning our work and for preparing the hotel for service have been purchased in the town of Niagara. It is our intention to continue this policy in so far as it is consitent with the economical management of the hotel. I might also state that it is our intention to carry out said policy to the extent to which the community responds and cooperates.\nNow therefore, in your consideration on all of the above, we respectfully petition that your grant us, Queens Royal Hotel Limited free water for the year 1925. Feeling that if such a petition is granted that we will be benefitted and that in return we will be able to help the community greatly.\nYours truly,\nQueens Royal Hotel Limited\n(no name)\nPresident\"\n\nKnown as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara. The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel.\n\nThis wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. An advertisement from 1893 states, \"The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished. In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity. A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.\"","Subjects":"Niagara-on-the-Lake\nQueens Royal Hotel\nTown Council\nTourism\nWater Bill","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/018/thumbs/9885521.jpg"]},{"Id":"204FEF81-3D55-4F2C-987B-363641057233","Name":"Envelope","Object ID":"1999.005.118","Date":"May 28, 1932","Dimensions":"15 x 9CM","Description":"A notice of uncollected taxes from J.M Crysler, Clerk of the Township of Niagara to Sydney Morris for lot 185 in Chautauqua.","People":"Morris, Sydney\nCrysler, John Morten\nSheppard, James H.\n","Subjects":"Return to sender\nArrear of Taxes\nChautauqua\nPlan 73 A\nproperty taxes\nUncollected taxes\nMississauga Beach Company","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/089/thumbs/1999005118-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/089/thumbs/1999005118.jpg"]},{"Id":"3526FB2E-7773-407C-B64C-658588247944","Name":"Postcard","Object ID":"994.485.042","Description":"Colour tinted postcard of a young child holding a fishing pole, wearing overalls and a hat, standing by a river.

The job entailed continual services 12 hours a day Sunday's and holiday's included.\n\nWhen the Queenston area became settled after the War of 1812, a ferry boat service was used to shuttle people and goods between Queenston and Lewiston, New York. The first bridge from Queenston to Lewiston was built in 1851, then destroyed by a winter storm in 1851. This resulted in a return to ferry service. The suspension bridge in Niagara Falls was replaced by the Upper Steel Arch Bridge in 1898. The suspension bridge was then moved from Niagara Falls to Queenston and was used to reconnect Queenston and Lewiston. The current Queenston-Lewiston Bridge was opened in November 1962 and the suspension bridge was dismantled in 1963.","People":"Whitwell, Francis\nMcDougald, John\n","Subjects":"Queenston-Lewiston Bridge\nSuspension Bridge\nCustoms Department of Canada","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2011035001.jpg"]},{"Id":"D96D44ED-C0EF-4404-9C47-234052138457","Name":"List","Object ID":"995.5.039","Date":"1881","Dimensions":"14.8 X 22.2 CM","Description":"Voters List of the Municipality of the Town of Niagara for the Year 1881.\nVoter lists include a detail list of persons registered and eligible to vote.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks.

Shaw was researching the property of the Niagara Harbour and Dock Company in search of references to Collingwood Street as a right of way.\nCollingwood Street was not found to be on any of the registered plans or property agreements.\n\n\"Dear sirs,\nThe Niagara Pumping station\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant and made a thorough search in the Registry office this morning in reference to the matter.\nWe now enclose you sketches from the plan of the Niagara Harbor and Dock Company's property filed on the 14th of May 1870- which clearly shows the ---- and bounds of the respective properties of Meneilly and Milloy. We also enclose you copies of the descriptions in the deeds from Galt and Cayley as trustees to Meneilly dated 17th June 1870 and in the deed from the Trustees office Hon. Adam Crooks to Mr. Milloy dated 22nd March 1888.\nYou will observe that in the first deed dated 17th of June 1879 there is no mention of Collingwood St, nor is Collingwood Street designed on the plan of the Dock Company's property, we take it that this street is the one laid out by Meneilly referred to in your letter as a right of way. There is no registered plan showing Collingwood St. The only thing from which the Conveyancer who made the description in the Milloy Deed could get to a street of that name is an Atlas of the Counties of Lincoln and Welland.\nBy H.B. Page\n\n(page 2)\nWhich was gather up in 1876 but which apparently is not very authentic in fact it is a very unreliable book in regard to places generally\nIt purports to be based on the most reliable information but it certainly fails to give correct information in regard to any plan and description we now enclose, you will be to make out what are -ights respectively of Meneilly and Milloy in regard to land covered by what is designated Collingwood St.\n\nMr. Currie the Registrar who know this property well for years past, and who camped with the local battalion not far from it, and traversed every foot of it for years back, says that the fence you refer to can only have been built a very few years, certainly not long enough to bar Mr Meneilly under the statute. We have not been able to get any other information but should you desire it we could perhaps learn something from inquiries of residents of the old Town.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long.

Constable William Mollynox presided and Ralfe Clench (later Colonel of the 1st Regiment of the Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812) was the clerk.\nAt this, and subsequent meetings, the town officers were appointed: clerk, assessors, collectors, town and church wardens, pound keepers, fence viewers and overseers of highways. The meetings were held yearly, in March, and were presided over by the constable. The bylaws passed at the first meeting, and reaffirmed at the following meetings, were few: \"Hogs cannot be allowed to run at large\" or \"the height of fences should be five feet to be lawful.\" In 1808, carriage drivers were directed to \"give half the road and keep to the right hand side\". However, there is no record of meetings being held from 1814 to 1816. Initially the town was called Newark but by 1800 the town is referred to as Niagara. A Board of Commissioners devised a division of labour for Township duties. Men 21 years and up had to give two days work per year. The last two pages also contain a register of marks used by farmers to identify their hogs and cattle. These lists of officers, labourers and farmers provide a valuable resource for researchers.

Clark was upset by this when he expected a full company of around 50 men to report for duty at Fort George and in effect threatened Major Ten Broeck. It was important to have the militia work on the fortifications at Fort George and new Fort Mississauga then under construction. Getting these places into a defensible shape was crucial, as was proven in July when the Americans invaded yet again and marched to the Town of Niagara following their victory at the Battle of Chippawa. The forts were sufficiently strong to prevent the Americans from attacking and recapturing Niagara.\nClark wrote that \"in future two companys (sic) will be required to serve for Seven days.\" He then stated that if more men did not readily respond when called out for duty then \"we will call for the whole Regiment and keep them out until the service required is performed.\" This goad undoubtedly spurred Ten Broeck to ensure that sufficient \"volunteers\" answered the call when required to prevent the whole regiment, every man between the ages of 16 to 60, from being forced to serve.\nThroughout the War of 1812, companies of normally around 50 militia men from the various regiments were called out by the British for active service for labour, to serve on guard duty, to transport supplies by wagon or bateau, to man sentry stations and, in dire emergencies, to fight alongside the British Regulars. Normally, these companies of men would be called out for relatively brief periods of time, a week or two normally, and would be relieved by another company. This ensured that the work was done while enabling the sedentary militia to carry on with their regular civilian pursuits. The provision of livestock and produce throughout the war was essential for feeding the troops on duty and the Native allies and their families.","People":"Clark, John\nTenBroeck, Jacob\n","Subjects":"War of 1812\nWar of 1812-14\nLincoln Militia\n4th Lincoln Militia","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/004/thumbs/2006036003.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/004/thumbs/2006036003-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/thumbs/2006036003-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/thumbs/2006036003-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"FBAD0841-7E36-4996-BF3C-959921944943","Name":"Certificate:Military","Object ID":"993.542.201","Date":"1916-FEB.18","Description":"A \"Certificate of Military Qualifications for N.C.O.

The company focused on making the route more about the experience than the destination. They promoted the scenic cliffs and trees of the river and partnered with the many attractions along the way. The original side-paddle wheel ships of the company's \"Niagara River Line\" were the Chicora (1864-1913), the Cibola (1887-1895), the Corona (1896-1937), the Chippewa (1893-1939) and the Cayuga (1906-1957), the only propeller-driven ship.","Relation":"Show Related Records...","Subjects":"Niagara Navigation Company\nsteamer ship\npassenger ship\ntransportation\nLake Ontario","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/019/thumbs/989557511.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/084/thumbs/989557511.jpg"]},{"Id":"5C5C4437-ED53-418B-9D8E-457241733993","Name":"Indenture","Object ID":"988.5.552","Date":"August 21, 1808","Dimensions":"32.5 X 20.5cm\n4 pages","Description":"Thomas McCormick petitioned the Midland District Surrogate Court to have a letter of Administration granted for the estate of his late Uncle Arthur McCormick, who died without a will.

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.\n\nThe grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.\n\nWith a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.\n\nBurning of Chautauqua, 1909\n\nOn August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the\nservants’ quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.","People":"Withrow, Reverend W.H.\nLake, John N.\nGurney, Edward\nWarren, Robert\nHouston, William\nHughes, James L.\nMcEwen, Reverend John\nWarren, Charles D.\nPeake, Lewis C.\nMacLaren, J.J.\n","Relation":"Show Related Records...","Subjects":"Hotel Chautauqua\nStrathcona\nNiagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement\namphitheatre\nMichigan Central Railway\ncottages\nfire\nNiagara Syndicate\nRyerson Park","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/086/thumbs/986088-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/986088.jpg"]},{"Id":"DDE7088A-8ECA-4359-8DDF-532759650160","Name":"Proclamation:Dispatch","Object ID":"990.5.302","Date":"1850-JAN.09","Description":"Dispatch from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Right Honourable the Earl of Elgin regarding a petition from Quebec asking for annexation to the U.S. Date January 9, 1850.","People":"Bruces, James (Earl of Elgin)\n","Subjects":"Quebec\nU.S. Annexation\nSeparatism","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/065/thumbs/9905302.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/065/thumbs/9905302-2.jpg"]},{"Id":"6F6EF4CD-7095-4B8B-A4D9-987890515647","Name":"Receipt","Object ID":"988.5.486","Date":"1844","Dimensions":"19 x 7.5 cm","Description":"Receipt For a Years' Subscription To the Globe, which is currently known as the Globe and Mail.\n\nTranscriptuion is as follows:\n\"Toronto, 19th Nov. 1844\nM.

As for the house I think the cheapest plan would be to move my blockhouse from the flats where we formerly lived as before the flood of the river to the place required, the cost would be as near as I can estimate. Taken it down rafting & drawing it on the spot $4. Raising or laying it up again $3. Required 4000 shingles 25 lbs. nails and take the boards out of the stone house for the floors [then?] so this part of a [fence?] would be saved.\nThe oxen & a cow I expect could be purchased but not without the money & pork & flour also can not be got short of the money. He would also require farming implements [such] as, plough, harrow, 1 chain [etc?]. The articles Mr. Burnham took over I did not take the invoice for it was sent away in a hurry thinking the snow was going to leave [us?] The jackets were considerably cut up by mice while remained in the store. After Mr. Burnham returned I took sick with rheumatism so it drained all my [limbs?] crooked. It is only about ten days ago since I got about.

This led her to approach numerous organizations to purchase the property so that it could be restored and transformed into a museum. Unfortunately, the stipulations that Mary added to the sale of the property (room and board for life plus a stipend) and the low assessment of the property drove any interested organizations away. Eventually, the Niagara Township forced Mary's hand. In this letter from the Town Treasurer, S. Stirling, they are threatening to sell the property because of her years of unpaid taxes. Eventually, she decided to subdivide the property to pay the taxes, which allowed her to live out the rest of her life on the homestead.","People":"Snider, Mary Elizabeth Olivia Josephine (nee Servos)\nStirling, Stanley\n","Subjects":"taxes\narrears\nproperty\ntreasurers","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/088/thumbs/2002044154.jpg"]},{"Id":"1331FA4B-CCBF-4D64-BFA8-023665184475","Name":"Postcard","Object ID":"2001.154","Description":"This postcard show the sentiment shared by many visitors who came to Niagara on the beautiful Cayuga steamship.

It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855.\n\nSometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a \"coloured\" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the \"Negro Burial Ground\".\n\nUnfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations.

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.\n\nThe grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.\n\nWith a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long.

The first meeting was held on August 17, 1793 by virtue of an Act of the Legislature of Upper Canada. Constable William Mollynox presided and Ralfe Clench (later Colonel of the 1st Regiment of the Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812) was the clerk.\nAt this, and subsequent meetings, the town officers were appointed: clerk, assessors, collectors, town and church wardens, pound keepers, fence viewers and overseers of highways. The meetings were held yearly, in March, and were presided over by the constable. The bylaws passed at the first meeting, and reaffirmed at the following meetings, were few: \"Hogs cannot be allowed to run at large\" or \"the height of fences should be five feet to be lawful.\" In 1808, carriage drivers were directed to \"give half the road and keep to the right hand side\". However, there is no record of meetings being held from 1814 to 1816. Initially the town was called Newark but by 1800 the town is referred to as Niagara. A Board of Commissioners devised a division of labour for Township duties. Men 21 years and up had to give two days work per year. The last two pages also contain a register of marks used by farmers to identify their hogs and cattle. These lists of officers, labourers and farmers provide a valuable resource for researchers. The Minute Book not only shows the determination of the early 'inhabitant electors' to govern themselves but also gives us a deeper understanding of their way of life.","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/023/thumbs/9945466.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/023/thumbs/9945466-2.jpg"]},{"Id":"602C7FA1-2F1F-451F-A642-855490214838","Name":"Drawing, Architectural","Object ID":"2015.022.002","Title":"The Manse - St. Andrews","Date":"1958","Dimensions":"73.5 cm x 58.5 cm","Description":"Architectural drawings of the Manse of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Niagara-on-the-Lake.\n\nDrawing and measurements by L.F.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long. The club house was the former Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.","Subjects":"Fort George Golf Course\nFort Mississauga Golf Course\nRecreation and Leisure\nSports\nGolfing","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"922F9DFD-25FE-4B4E-AEDD-909614213832","Name":"List","Object ID":"992.5.008","Date":"1915-SEP.23","Description":"A list of commanders and Corps for a parade state in September 1915 at Camp Niagara.

Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer.\nWhen the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year.\nThe recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.\nWhen asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. \"I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare\" said the Colonel. \"My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.\"\nWindeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long. The club house was the former Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters.","Subjects":"Fort George Golf Course\nFort Mississauga Golf Course\nRecreation and Leisure\nSports\nGolfing","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/98852046-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"E4F0194B-6ABD-444C-94DB-212548479330","Name":"Stereograph","Object ID":"993.074(A-H)","Date":"1890 C.","Dimensions":"9 x 18 cm","Description":"Stereographs were the original virtual reality!\nA stereoscope is a device for viewing a stereoscopic pair of images, depicting left-eye and right-eye views of the same scene, when viewed they become a single three-dimensional image.\n\n\nA-Railway bridge across the Rhone.

G. Williams.\nThe house is also known recently as Charlou. Built in 1845 by Alexander Davidson, a postmaster in Niagara (1837), and the first mayor of Niagara on the Lake (1850). The Ball Family of Niagara purchased the home in 1906 and owned it until 1981. Kathleen Ball (1890-1981), daughter of Alfred Ball, was the primary resident at this time. Since 1981, the owners have added a family room, master bedroom suite, pool, double car garage with an above guest suite and a glassed in porch. The current front door is original to the house. In the drawing, completed in the 1950's. The front door is hidden by a portico.\n\nJohn G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949.

Book 5 and book 6 had letters on the coupons, B, S, M, Y, V, and X.\nRationing is a form of controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services. The theory is to allow each individual a portion of the scarce resource which is being distributed over a specific time period. It is used to control resource pricing through manipulating supply and demand and tries to reduce the spread of a black market.

The Ball Family of Niagara purchased the home in 1906 and owned it until 1981. Kathleen Ball (1890-1981), daughter of Alfred Ball, was the primary resident at this time. Since 1981, the owners have added a family room, master bedroom suite, pool, double car garage with an above guest suite and a glassed in porch. The current front door is original to the house.

Memorial Hall, is Ontario’s first purpose-built Museum and as built largely due to the efforts of Janet Carnochan, the Niagara Historical Society’s first President.\n\nWhen the Society began collecting artefacts of significant interest, several people doubted the Society’s ability, believing that everything had been given away or destroyed, or that no one would either give or lend anything for such a purpose. Fortunately, the Society ignored these sentiments. The early collection produced artefacts of both local and national interest, many of which are still preserved by the society’s Museum. The society was always searching for a way to memorialize the United Empire Loyalists who settled in Niagara. In 1898, the notion that this memorial could take the form of a building to house the society’s collection was first introduced. By 1903, with the collection at over 2,000 items, the society began planning the construction of this building. It would be called Memorial Hall.\n\nJanet spearheaded the fundraising campaign and the society managed to successfully raise ($4,924.78) 95% of the costs, only managing to borrow $275 from the bank, which was paid off 2 years later. On June 4, 1907 the Society opened the first purpose-built museum in Ontario, which to this day is still apart of the Museum complex.","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/022/thumbs/994046.jpg"]},{"Id":"F06EA5A2-4948-4B08-9013-100403063393","Name":"Drawing","Object ID":"991.090","Date":"1816","Description":"This sketch of the log house of William Riley is the only extant image of an early home built by a former slave in the town of Niagara's \"coloured village\", roughly the area bounded by King, William, Ann and Butler streets. The sketch was donated to the museum by Mary Ann Guillen, Mr. Riley's daughter, who was Janet Carnochan's major source of information about the town's 19th century black community. The drawing was done for Mrs. Guillen by a female acquaintance, shortly before the squared timber building was pulled down in the 1880's. William Riley, an escaped slave from Fredericksburg, Virginia, bought the one acre town lot, 276, at the corner of Mary and Victoria streets, from William Dickson for £50 in 1819, becoming the third black man to own property in the village. The price was fair for land in the area. However, one does wonder why Mr. Dickson paid only five shillings for it a short time earlier. Neither transaction was registered until 1886. Mr. Riley built the house in 1819, a year after his marriage at Lake Lodge (the home of Rev. Robert Addison), to Rev. Addison's German servant Fanny. By 1851, eight family members lived in the house: William, Fanny (a. 57), their children Mary Ann (27), Fanny (20), Edward (18) and three grandchildren, William (11), Fanny (3) and Edward (1). After Riley's death in 1860, Edward and his sisters inherited lot 276. The last family member to own the land was William's granddaughter, Fanny Rowley, who also owned 177 King and 143 King Street, and the Rowley Block on Queen Street. She left town in 1905, ending the family's connection with lot 276. Mrs. Guillen's lively and informative recollections about the Riley family and the larger black community can be found in Niagara Historical Society Pamphlet #2.","People":"Riley, William\nDickson, William\nGuillen, Mary Ann\n","Subjects":"coloured village\nslave\nKing Street\nWilliam Street\nAnn Street\nButler Street","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/026/thumbs/991090.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/085/thumbs/991090-6.jpg"]},{"Id":"91A2B168-8E31-43EF-895E-425617043704","Name":"Statement of Account","Object ID":"989.5.702.1","Date":"1838-NOV.&DEC.","Description":"A list of amounts owed to militia men under Capt.

Shaw was researching the property of the Niagara Harbour and Dock Company in search of references to Collingwood Street as a right of way.\nCollingwood Street was not found to be on any of the registered plans or property agreements.\n\n\"Dear sirs,\nThe Niagara Pumping station\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant and made a thorough search in the Registry office this morning in reference to the matter.\nWe now enclose you sketches from the plan of the Niagara Harbor and Dock Company's property filed on the 14th of May 1870- which clearly shows the ---- and bounds of the respective properties of Meneilly and Milloy. We also enclose you copies of the descriptions in the deeds from Galt and Cayley as trustees to Meneilly dated 17th June 1870 and in the deed from the Trustees office Hon. Adam Crooks to Mr. Milloy dated 22nd March 1888.\nYou will observe that in the first deed dated 17th of June 1879 there is no mention of Collingwood St, nor is Collingwood Street designed on the plan of the Dock Company's property, we take it that this street is the one laid out by Meneilly referred to in your letter as a right of way. There is no registered plan showing Collingwood St. The only thing from which the Conveyancer who made the description in the Milloy Deed could get to a street of that name is an Atlas of the Counties of Lincoln and Welland.\nBy H.B. Page\n\n(page 2)\nWhich was gather up in 1876 but which apparently is not very authentic in fact it is a very unreliable book in regard to places generally\nIt purports to be based on the most reliable information but it certainly fails to give correct information in regard to any plan and description we now enclose, you will be to make out what are -ights respectively of Meneilly and Milloy in regard to land covered by what is designated Collingwood St.\n\nMr. Currie the Registrar who know this property well for years past, and who camped with the local battalion not far from it, and traversed every foot of it for years back, says that the fence you refer to can only have been built a very few years, certainly not long enough to bar Mr Meneilly under the statute. We have not been able to get any other information but should you desire it we could perhaps learn something from inquiries of residents of the old Town.

Antoni was one of several Polish Falcon instructors who attended Camp Kosciusko.\n\nAntoni Wiacek was born to a peasant family on January 11, 1889, in the Austrian-controlled part of Poland. In 1912, he emigrated to the United States, where he settled in New York and became a member of the Polish Falcons Alliance of America. He completed the Falcons' instructor course in Philadelphia, which was designed to create a corps of military instructors to train future officers for a Polish Army.\nWiacek was part of the inaugural Polish Officers' School of Infantry class at the University of Toronto and upon completion, he graduated as a Lieutenant. Antoni was given a position at the Polish Army Recruitment office in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the summer of 1918, he joined the Firs Rifle Regiment of the Polish Army in France.\nIn the spring of 1919, Wiacek was transferred to Poland to take part in the Polish-Soviet War, where he was put in command of his own company. In May of 1920, Antoni was shot in battle near Lipowca-Napodowski. Even though he was injured he carried on leading his company. Among the Regiment Officers, his actions were regarded with the highest honour. He would go on to repeat these actions again in battle near Rowne, where he was seriously wounded.\nAfter being discharged from the army, he was awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari, Croix de Guerre and the Cross of Valour (three times). After the war, Wiacek stayed in Poland to help his country regain its independence. Sadly, Antoni was executed in what has become known as the Katyn Forest Crime, where 15,000 Polish Army officers were executed by the Soviet Army during World War II.","People":"Wiacek, Antoni\n","Subjects":"First World War\nWWI\nPolish Soldiers\nCamp Kosciuszko\nNiagara Camp\nPolish Falcons Association of America","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/thumbs/2016033001.jpg"]},{"Id":"9E47F774-4B3E-4936-9E51-504654300440","Name":"letter","Object ID":"994.160","Date":"March 1, 1927","Description":"After the passing of Janet Carnochan, the Niagara High School Alumni decided to create a memorial to her in the form of a scholarship to be awarded yearly to a pupil of the Niagara High School.\nThis notice is a request for donations, which can be received by William Quinn, of the Imperial Bank.

The first one was formed by William Kirby, a respected author and historian, in 1892, but it was short lived. Janet Carnochan was chosen as the Niagara Historical Society President, much to her surprise and reluctance, and she served as Society President for 30 years. Under her guidance the organization built up a collection of artifacts, starting in 1896, related to this historic town and the Niagara Peninsula. She even had the forethought to commission a local artist to produce paintings of the town which now show buildings that no longer exist. Many of the Museum's most prized possessions arrived under her leadership. The current Memorial Hall, owned by the Society, is the first purpose-built museum in Ontario, and was erected largely due to Janet's efforts. After the museum opened, Janet acted as curator until she retired in 1925.","Subjects":"Niagara Historical Society\nNiagara-on-the-Lake Museum","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/065/thumbs/9823623.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/065/thumbs/9823623-2.jpg"]},{"Id":"7898B8E7-78B9-4FE9-B187-421831022613","Name":"Receipt","Object ID":"982.318.60","Date":"March 22, 1830","Dimensions":"5.5 x 20 cm","Description":"This scrap piece of paper was used as a receipt, dated March 22, 1830, from Samuel Street, Esquire, paid forty dollars.

He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer.\nWhen the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year.\nThe recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.\nWhen asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. \"I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare\" said the Colonel. \"My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.\"\nWindeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long.

The story of the Servos Family in Niagara can be told through the history of the original homestead, initially called Four Mile Creek Mills, off Lakeshore Road. The property was previously owned by:\nDaniel Servos, until 1803\nJohn D Servos, until 1847\nPeter C Servos, until 1879; and\nMary Servos, until 1905\n\nThe property was continued to be owned by Mary’s daughter until the 1940s.\n\nDaniel Servos, a Butler's Ranger, built the family homestead in 1783 near Four Mile Creek and Lakeshore Road. On the property he also built a grist mill and tannery, and operated a Trading Post for the early settlers of Niagara. Upon Daniel’s death in 1803, his son, John took over the operation of the mills and farmed the property until his death. Peter, who married Mary Ball, owned the family homestead until the couples divorce, when the property was transferred to Mary.\n\nLife was not easy for Mary from this point on. She raised their four children while also continuing the management of the farm. The day to day work was left to hired workers, but she managed all her own affairs, lived on her own means and owned all the stock and chattels on the farm. When Mary wasn’t managing the affairs of the farm or her children, she turned one of the rooms in the home into a Museum and displayed family documents and artefacts that were associated with members of the Servos family. This laid the ground work for her daughter, Mary Elizabeth Olivia Josephine Servos Snider, to further develop the family’s historical roots. Additionally, under her tutelage, the homestead acquired the name \"Palatine Hill\". This was the first time that this property had not been known as Four Mile Creek Mills.","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/007/thumbs/2011017001.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/007/thumbs/2011017001-2.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/007/thumbs/2011017001-3.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/007/thumbs/2011017001-4.jpg"]},{"Id":"411EEF2D-EF7D-4247-98BA-756830361857","Name":"Bill","Object ID":"989.5.232","Date":"1829-SEP.","Description":"A handwritten bill to H.J.

As for the house I think the cheapest plan would be to move my blockhouse from the flats where we formerly lived as before the flood of the river to the place required, the cost would be as near as I can estimate. Taken it down rafting & drawing it on the spot $4. Raising or laying it up again $3. Required 4000 shingles 25 lbs. nails and take the boards out of the stone house for the floors [then?] so this part of a [fence?] would be saved.\nThe oxen & a cow I expect could be purchased but not without the money & pork & flour also can not be got short of the money. He would also require farming implements [such] as, plough, harrow, 1 chain [etc?]. The articles Mr. Burnham took over I did not take the invoice for it was sent away in a hurry thinking the snow was going to leave [us?] The jackets were considerably cut up by mice while remained in the store. After Mr. Burnham returned I took sick with rheumatism so it drained all my [limbs?] crooked. It is only about ten days ago since I got about. I afterward neglected all business but I must make up loss time at the next Court of Request, then I will send you many.\nIf you choose I will [sign] and furnish you with oxen for that waggon I owe you, The house ought to be built soon if your man Friday intends to commence work this spring so you may let me know your intentions [???] next [Month?] I understand that Mr. Street has purchased all Mr. Jones tract of Land here which will be all settled soon.\nI am,\nDear Sir, Yours Truly,\nJohn Norton","People":"Crooks, John\nNorton, John Junior\n","Subjects":"Grand River\nNative History","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2012012072.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2012012072-2.jpg"]},{"Id":"6A48E02D-9CE5-4027-8AB9-805173140705","Name":"Receipt:Business","Object ID":"989.5.507.8","Date":"1908-AUG.29","Description":"Receipt from The Times Publishing for badges and programs and papers.

Andrew Heron (c.1765-1848), a merchant and land speculator resident in Niagara since 1785 was instrumental in the library's organization.\nThe library flourished and by late 1812 offered 827 volumes to its subscribers.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par).

John William Jackson grew up in Toronto, the place he was working at this time, so he most likely commuted from his family home instead of staying at the barracks. For that reason, he would need proof that he is allowed to be out past curfew or in public while in uniform if he was to be stopped by military police.

Much historical, architectural and cultural value has been destroyed in the transition from wilderness to civilization. This pamphlet proposes that we try and salvage what is left.\nThe history of Niagara-on-the-Lake in the 20th Century transitioned from the boom times up and into the 1920's, followed by an economic down time which did not improve until the late 1950's.

On December 12, 1895, fifteen citizens of Niagara-on-the-Lake met at the Public Library to re-establish a local historical society. The first one was formed by William Kirby, a respected author and historian, in 1892, but it was short lived. Janet Carnochan was chosen as the Niagara Historical Society President, much to her surprise and reluctance, and she served as Society President for 30 years. Under her guidance the organization built up a collection of artifacts, starting in 1896, related to this historic town and the Niagara Peninsula. She even had the forethought to commission a local artist to produce paintings of the town which now show buildings that no longer exist. Many of the Museum's most prized possessions arrived under her leadership. The current Memorial Hall, owned by the Society, is the first purpose-built museum in Ontario, and was erected largely due to Janet's efforts. After the museum opened, Janet acted as curator until she retired in 1925.","Subjects":"Niagara Historical Society\nNiagara-on-the-Lake Museum","images":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/065/thumbs/9823623.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/065/thumbs/9823623-2.jpg"]},{"Id":"62625625-3BDC-40E4-98EA-085070233976","Name":"Program","Object ID":"988.5.141","Date":"1915","Dimensions":"30 X 23 CM.","Description":"Program of the Grand International Red Cross Fete, held at the Queen's Royal Hotel on August 20th and 21st, 1915.
